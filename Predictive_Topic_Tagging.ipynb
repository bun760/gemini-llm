              "   'Introduction:\\n\\nMachine learning (ML) is a category of algorithm that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of ML is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output. ML is an application of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and train. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\\n\\nThe process of learning begins with observations or data, such as direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\\n\\nML algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. ML is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of ML.\\n\\nData mining is a field of study within ML and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. It allows computers to handle new situations via analysis, self-training, observation, and experience.\\n\\nHow does it work?\\n\\nThe algorithm is trained using a training data set to create a model. When new input data is introduced to the ML algorithm, it makes a prediction on the basis of the model.\\n\\nThe prediction is evaluated for accuracy and if the accuracy is acceptable, then the algorithm is deployed. If the accuracy is not acceptable, then the algorithm is trained again and again with an augmented training data set. Our brain trains itself by identifying the features and patterns of knowledge/data received, thus enabling itself to successfully identify or distinguish between various things.\\n\\nSimilarly, we feed knowledge/data to the machine, this data is divided into two parts namely, training data and testing data. The machine learns the patterns and features from them and trains itself to take decisions like identifying, classifying or predicting new data\\n\\nClassifications:\\n\\nSupervised ML: The program is trained on a pre-defined set of training examples, which then facilitate its ability to reach an accurate conclusion when given new data\\n\\nThe program is trained on a pre-defined set of training examples, which then facilitate its ability to reach an accurate conclusion when given new data Unsupervised ML: Algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.

We could perhaps talk of responsible contribution of data, yet I am unsure of how that would function in practice.\\n\\nBefore defining the term let us run through a few short examples, for fun of course, and see what you think.\\n\\n23andMe and Ancestry DNA\\n\\nThe fun: look where you’re from, wow! Connect with your relatives.\\n\\nData: genetic data from saliva, and family trees.\\n\\nBuyer/collaborator example: genetic drug research.\\n\\niRobot IoT home products\\n\\nThe fun: a robot that cleans your room!\\n\\nData: maps of private homes.\\n\\nBuyer/collaborator example: Google for advertising.\\n\\nAmazon Alexa Smart Speaker\\n\\nThe fun: order a speaker to do things!\\n\\nData: voice data and behavioural data.\\n\\nBuyer/collaborator: for internal use in Amazon and/or highest bidder.\\n\\nIKEA smart lighting\\n\\nThe fun: control your lighting!\\n\\nData: behavioural data from homes connected to your phone.\\n\\nBuyer/collaborator: Internal use and phone companies such as Xiaomi.\\n\\nThere are likely more examples that can be made. These examples are oversimplified and reduced perhaps too much, yet it is only meant as broad brush strokes for an illustrative train of thought.\\n\\nWhat is databaiting?\\n\\nLet us start by examining the two words that I put together, and see if it is a useful term or inadequate to describe the phenomenon. First data and then baiting.\\n\\nData is facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. It is a set of values of subjects with respect to qualitative or quantitative variables. For most companies I have met dealing with data the perception is that it can be measured and quantified, and this is a dominant view. Increasingly there is talks of monetising data and the term being compared to raw resources such as oil. This refers to the idea of raw data (unprocessed) as something that can be processed to gain value. Some even talk of a new gold rush and compare data to minerals. Data can be used in many ways from helping to cure cancer, optimising logistics and training algorithms to learn how to respond to a given situation or context. We could argue it is not neutral and shaped by those who gather the data and interpret the data.\\n\\nBaiting in this context to entice someone. One understanding of bait can be to entice fish or animals. The human being is as proposed within the kingdom animalia, not above and beyond nature or other animals, so we are also susceptible to this. The context some would think of could be related with fishing. When related to humans, the person who is the victim of baiting is usually left hurt and confused. Something is said to elicit an emotional response that leads to an action, even when someone knows they have been baited it is hard to know how to deal with it.\\n\\nDatabaiting I would suggest is: to entice someone to submit their data by eliciting an emotional response.\\n\\nThe victim often does not know how their data has been used and can be hurt when they find out. Your data could be used to train a surveillance data set for an insurance company, arms manufacturer or eCommerce. You will likely not know of this. You know the company might sell your data, not to whom and you are tempted by a product or service that will improve your life. You therefore submit yourself (your data) in exchange without being aware of the consequences. This is what I myself have done many times over.\\n\\nInformed Consent\\n\\nA peculiar phenomenon is images on smoking packets in Norway and other places around the world. You often find the message: “smoking kills,” and it can be accompanies by an image of a horrible picture related to the range of diseases you can get from smoking regularly.\\n\\nI do not claim that using software services or hardware collecting data will kill you, however it may influence your life in ways that you did not intend.\\n\\nI do not know how much this has helped. We could still imagine the scenario with brutally honest informed consent from technology companies that gathers your data and uses it for a purpose you were unaware of.\\n\\nThis may not happen in the near future, but it provides for a fun thought experiment. I am not sure if this is the solution, however we could imagine the following ridiculous situations:\\n\\nWarning: this product may be sold as behavioural data to your nearest shop. We may sell this to someone who aggregates data and we may not know where it goes ourselves, because the laws are not transparent enough, and your data is devilishly hard to track. We do our best though.\\n\\nThank you for submitting your DNA sample! Be aware that it could be used to produce a drug or two for some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. We thought we should mention this because we value honesty.\\n\\nBy submitting your psychometric information in exchange for a larger social network we hope you are aware of the consequences. We can offer you more suitable products, but we will get better at directing you towards a purchase.\\n\\nThe information you just provided can be used both for companies to sell you products/services or politicians to reach you, we do not discriminate too much as long as they pay. Additionally we have expanded so quickly that we often lack staff speaking the language in given countries to monitor for possible infringements. In the countries we have staff the volume of content posted tends to be too high. We are expanding rapidly as you may know.\\n\\nIf you scroll too much and compare yourself to your friends you may stand a higher chance to get depressed, so limit your scrolling if you can. Remember this service is addictive and must be used with care. We use your behavioural data to make you stay longer at this platform to sell more advertisement.\\n\\nRefreshing right?\\n\\nData Brokers\\n\\nUnless you’re in the business for information you may never have heard of a data broker, but they have heard of you. Earlier this year (2019) Steven Melendez and Alex Pasternack wrote an article about data brokers in Fast Company. This law requires those that buy and sell data to enter into a registry. On the other hand as the article says:\\n\\nEven Vermont’s first-of-its-kind law, which went into effect last month, doesn’t require data brokers to disclose who’s in their databases, what data they collect, or who buys it. Nor does it require brokers to give consumers access to their own data or opt out of data collection.\\n\\nThe article showed an interesting chart.\\n\\nTypes of consumer data and data companies. Some companies included in the chart may not be covered by the Vermont law. Image by Cracked Labs an Institute for Critical Digital Culture.\\n\\nThe chart within the article from Fast Company led me to look into the Institute for Critical Digital Culture within Cracked Labs. Cracked Labs is an independent research institute and a creative laboratory based in Vienna, Austria. It investigates the socio-cultural impacts of information technology and develops social innovations in the field of digital culture. It is a non-profit organization and was established in 2012 to strengthen a participatory and self-determined use of information and communication technology as well as the free access to knowledge and information — independently from commercial or governmental interests.\\n\\nThe following two larger graphics are retrieved from the article Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life.',\n",

              "   'Innovation in health care: Wave 1 and 2\\n\\nIn my view, the biggest challenge is the balancing act between solving today’s problems and creating an innovative health care system for tomorrow. We have seen several big waves of digital innovation in the health sector in recent years, with mixed results.\\n\\nFor example, in 2008, Google entered the health care market and attempted to get the most out of its data power. Or a few years later, in 2011, startups like MySugr, Mimi, Tinitracs tried to set new standards, but not all of them managed to scale in Europe and realized their full potential here. Was it because they simply started too early or because they did not involve healthcare professionals?\\n\\nIntegration is king: Wave 3 and 4\\n\\nSince 2016, startups such as Vivy, Ada and Clue in Europe have been trying to push forward exactly this development: the integrated solution. In this wave, I noticed that we are at a crossroads in the digital health care sector, especially in Germany. We have learned that certain insurance models don’t work for investors because contracts are way too selective with too little users. The same applies to the political framework, in which the General Practitioners are particularly protected. Speaking of the political conditions, the subject of data and their secure handling often block many good ideas and initiatives in advance.\\n\\nIn my opinion, we need to bridge the gap between the established health care providers with in-depth knowledge and innovative startups that are agile, bring in fresh, digital ideas and new ways of thinking. For this, it is inevitable to integrate new digital solutions into the existing health care system and processes. If this works, I am convinced that both sides can benefit from each other, in the interest of the quality of health care and the patients.\\n\\nIntegration is king\\n\\nThe fourth wave: Three suggestions for intelligent health care\\n\\nIt is time for action now, for a fourth wave of innovation in health care. Time to put our learnings into action and to create sustainable, resilient solutions. The political preconditions have changed as well: There are 3 billion euros available for the AI strategy of the German Federal Government across all industries. And there is the first draft of the so-called Digital Supply Law with the aim of ensuring a better supply through digitization and innovation.\\n\\nHowever, it is not only a matter of money and the legislator but also of ambition. We need to embrace a new culture — we need to realize that failure can even be a good thing if we learn from it and move forward to find an even better solution. If we do not adopt this mindset soon, the brightest minds will develop their ideas somewhere else under better conditions.\\n\\nBut what does that mean in particular? Here are my three suggestions for health care startups and enthusiasts on how to tackle the challenges ahead:\\n\\n1. We do not need to develop a European version of an existing solution, but rather find a European answer to the challenge of our aging society, independently from what is happening in the US or elsewhere because the health care systems differ vastly. So, let go of the idea of catching up with the big players and work on your own ideas.\\n\\n2. Be self-confident: Anyone who wants to promote innovation in this sector knows where the big problems are. Get the solutions, give feedback, don’t use excuses, go ahead and do it.\\n\\n3. Make sure that digitization and AI are present in all health study programs, otherwise, the next generation can only think of solutions on paper or Excel.\\n\\nNote from the editorial staff: We would like to look at artificial intelligence and other future technologies from different perspectives — even in industries in which Porsche is not itself active. That’s why we always invite experts to discuss their opinions on the development of technologies on our blog. You’re interested too? Get in touch with us!',\n",

              "   'I feel liberated whenever I got the opportunity to write about buzzing technology like AI or IoT or something else on platforms like Medium. I feel like going on and on….no stopping. Today I will be gossiping about AI in the guise of Parag Mahajan’s masterpiece — Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.\\n\\nSeriously, I personally given so much time on YouTube, in the books, on tech blogs just to understand one thing that AI is still in the nascent stage and its definition and layers are yet to be explored fully like our solar system or universe. Is AI like universe — so vast and intriguing? Maybe, I feel. Yes! AI is a broad term and things like ML and DL come under this umbrella. People or scientists associated with it want to make it do everything that humans do, including thinking and emotional reasoning, etc. I doubt whether possible or not. Anyway, the book is about AI in Healthcare — not many doctors feel good about AI being bossing over them. But Parag puts that AI is going to help them in their regular tasks like scanning, image reading, and reminders to patients, and so on. The scope of AI in healthcare and pharmaceutical companies is endless.\\n\\nToday, if I come and say that AI can do all that a well-qualified or practiced doctor does every day, people will frown and may take me as a Luddite or some person with an over dose of optimism. I don’t know what they think, rather care? But Parag thinks otherwise, from quotes to fears to risks to benefits, he has charted out the best possible roads AI can take into the field of healthcare. The core thing is data — all agree. However, its usage in the right direction matters, not using blindly and biasedly. He is so true about one thing — if algorithms fed wrong, they will go wrong, may lead to machine errors and misdiagnoses. But the current look at the state suggests that if AI applied deaths caused by medical error and misdiagnoses can be curbed. Misdiagnoses is a potential threat to humanity. I don’t know, neither sure about whether a robot can perform surgery using metal mind. Even people will find it difficult to get accustomed. AI is not like monkeys being sent to space for death experiments.\\n\\nOn the other hand, big giants like IBM, Google, Phillips, Baidu, etc. are investing and doing research about digital healthcare. So far, EMR and EHR is possible and into practice in developed nations. That saves a lot of paper…what trusting AI-fed machines for reading your anatomy reports can be trusted blindly. Risk and fear are possible…but maybe with time people get accustomed to it. Before AI can be implemented and run full-fledged in healthcare, it has to win confidence and build credibility in the transport field. Otherwise, according to me, the scope of AI looks bleak and in the fog.\\n\\nThis book can open window for multi-dimensional debates, however, the author has just given focus on semblance. He should be writing in his next edition as how it will be possible and who will bear the cost of AI in clinical system, as healthcare is already transcending all mediocre financial limits. Will AI be able to make healthcare cost effective and a time-saver? It can be adopted in snatches, not fully, doctors will not allow that to happen. Still fingers crossed…till I read another power packed book on the power of AI in healthcare.',\n",

              "   'Anand Rao, PwC’s Global AI Leader, was a speaker at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dalian, China, July 1–3. During the conference PwC introduced a « Responsible AI Toolkit, » a diagnostic survey that is designed to help organizations access their understanding and application of responsible and ethical AI practices. PwC has identified five areas organizations need to focus on in order to tailor their particular strategy : governance, ethics and regulation, interpretability and explainability, robustness and security and bias and fairness.The toolkit is compatible with a AI toolkit for the C-Suite and boards introduced by the World Economic Forum earlier this year. PwC is partnering with the Forum’s Centre For The Fourth Industrial Revolution to further develop such guidelines. Rao met with The Innovator at the conference to discuss why leaders need to take responsiblity for — and action on — responsible AI practices.\\n\\nQ : Earlier this year 85% of CEOS said AI would significantly change the way they do business in the next five years and 84% acknowledged that AI-based decisions need to be explainable in order to be trusted. How do corporates earn that trust ?\\n\\nAR : To me trust is something you develop. You don’t declare yourself to be trustworthy.The C-Suite needs to actively drive and engage in the end-to-end integration of a responsible and ethically-led strategy for the development of AI in order to balance the economic potential gains. One without the other represents fundamental reputational, operational and financial risks. As an audit firm we are naturally cautious and conservative. We are not saying AI should not be done. We are just saying make sure you do it in a responsible way.\\n\\nQ : What does that mean in practice ?\\n\\nAR : There are now more than 72 different guidelines on AI & Ethics issued by various organizations. What we have done is used AI to analyze AI ethics and identified the key things needed to translate concepts into good practice. For example one common guideline says « AI needs to be beneficial. » How do you translate that into the banking area when, for example, you build a model for mortgages? There is a difference in what is legal and what is ethical. If one of the decision-making factors is based on zipcode this is often highly coordinated with ethnicity which is legally ok and ethically it is not. We don’t say what is right and what is wrong. We just run an analysis with our tool kit to help companies decide which variables should be used for decision making. If a variable is legally permited but ethically questionable then a company needs to make a choice on whether they want to do it or not and look at what is the cost if they do use it. And, companies need to look at whether they can justify what they are doing when the regulator comes in. It is about explainability. Companies need to evaluate deep learning algorithms. You may get good results for the data but you may not be able to explain how the AI reached its decision. Another algorithm may not be as accurate but is easily explainable. When it comes to your end customer and a mortgage that has been denied you don’t want to be in a position where you have to say ‘I don’t know how that decision was reached.’ So companies have to figure out how they want to balance this.\\n\\nQ : What else should companies be thinking about when it comes to damage control ?\\n\\nAR : Be very careful when and where and why you are using AI and determine what level of governance you need. What do the board of directors need to know ? Some companies are looking at insurance for AI. How long would it take your company to detect a problem before you get a call from the press and how quickly can you react ? All of these things matter.\\n\\nQ : What do you advise companies to do ?\\n\\nAR : First and foremost try to get educated on AI, to really understand what is AI. There is a lot of confusion with broader digital transformation, data and analytics, automation and AI. They are very related and yet distinct. Start looking at existing risks and governance processes and see where and what you need to update. Don’t think of new efforts that cost millions of dollars. Start small and determine how much AI is getting used, how are you going to monitor the increased use of AI and think about how you are going to get the ROI from it.',\n",

Please do so, our guys worked really hard on this:\\n\\nFrom the Editor: Where We See Shapes AI Sees Textures\\n\\nImage analysis is one of the hottest areas of artificial intelligence research. In recent years, AI image classification algorithms have become famous both for its progress as well as its mistakes. We all have seen the news of AI models misclassifying images of dark-skinned humans or tricky objects. While vision systems powered by AI have been able to outperform humans on some image recognition tasks under fixed conditions, they also fail miserably with the introductions of the simplest distortions. Now a team of German AI researchers has an idea why.\\n\\nIn a recent study presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May, a team of researchers from the University of Tübingen in Germany highlighted the sharp contrast between how humans and machines “think,”. While humans are clearly more biased towards shapes when analyzing images, the current generation of AI techniques focuses more on textures which also introduces a lot of confusions. If this result is proven to be correct, it can help to improve the accuracy of image analysis systems to surpass humans under all sorts of conditions.\\n\\nNow let’s take a look at the core developments in AI research and technology this week:\\n\\nAI Research\\n\\nAI researchers from education powerhouse Udacity, published a paper proposing a method to generate videos lessons based on audio narrations.\\n\\n>Read more in this coverage from VentureBeat\\n\\nIn a shocking discovery, AI researchers from the University of Tübingen, Germany Proved that image recognition systems are typically bias towards textures, not shapes, which is the root caused of many misclassifications.\\n\\n>Read more in this coverage from Quantas Magazine\\n\\nIn a somewhat surprising paper, AI researcher from the University of Tartu, Estonia proposed a test that shows that deep reinforcement learning agents can learn from the perspectives of other agents.\\n\\n>See the complete research paper here\\n\\nCool AI Tech Releases\\n\\nFacebook open sourced an implementation of a deep learning recommendation model that combines concepts of collaborative filtering and predictive analytics.\\n\\n>Read more in this blog post from the Facebook AI Research team\\n\\nAI researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology open sourced Gen, a new probabilistic programming language for causal inference.\\n\\n>Read more in this coverage from MIT News\\n\\nTensorFlow Lite has been ported to the Arduino IOT operating system which means that soon we will see deep learning models running on Arduino micro-controllers.\\n\\n>Read more in this blog post from Hackster.io\\n\\nAI in the Real World\\n\\nSelf-driving startup Tier IV raised $100 million for an open source platform for autonomous vehicles.\\n\\n>Read more in this coverage from Crunchbase News\\n\\nIBM and MIT collaborated on launching GANPaint, a system that uses AI to help designers add, modify or remove objects to images without loosing the core context.\\n\\n>Read more in this coverage from MIT News\\n\\nResearchers from Harvard University use AI to try and figure out whether the authorship of some of the most disputed works in The Beatles’ back catalog can be attributed to John Lennon or Paul McCartney.\\n\\n>Read more in this coverage from the Financial Times',\n",

Natassha Selvaraj Jul 1·5 min read\\n\\nPhoto by Headway on Unsplash\\n\\nJust over a year go, I was working part time as a private tutor while studying.\\n\\nI was earning only slightly more than minimum wage during this time, just enough to cover expenses like food and petrol.\\n\\nI lost my job during the pandemic, and was told that I could only go back to teaching once the nationwide lockdown was lifted.\\n\\nAfter this happened, I suddenly realized I had a lot of free time. I didn’t have to attend classes at university any longer. I also no longer had a job.\\n\\nI took this opportunity to teach myself data science.\\n\\nIn just over a year, I managed to triple my salary by creating multiple streams of income with my data science knowledge.\\n\\nHere’s how:\\n\\n1. Data science job\\n\\nI managed to land a data science internship which then turned into a full time job offer.\\n\\nThere are two advantages of taking a full time data science job:\\n\\nAlthough this isn’t where a huge portion of my income comes from, its consistent, which I like.\\n\\nI learn something new everyday. I work on my communication skills when talking to people in different teams, build and scale machine learning models to large datasets, and come up with different techniques to improve customer journey.\\n\\nThe best part about this job is that unlike freelancing, I don’t get to choose the projects I work on.\\n\\nThis means that even if I don’t know how to do something, I have no choice but to learn within a day or two or get it done.\\n\\nThe task almost always gets done, and I walk away having learnt something new.\\n\\nAlso, as an introvert, I used to find it difficult to communicate with people and present during team meetings.\\n\\nI didn’t really have a choice once taking on a role as a data scientist, because a lot of my work involves presenting model insights and gathering business requirements from the client.\\n\\nDue to this, my communication skills have improved dramatically over the past year.\\n\\n2. Data science blogging\\n\\nDuring my free time (usually at night or during weekends), I write for data science.\\n\\nI started out with writing articles around projects I built, in order to strengthen my portfolio.\\n\\nI enjoyed creating, and my articles were a way of sharing my journey with others. I didn’t know anyone else at that time to study with, and nobody I knew shared the same interest as me in data science.\\n\\nI wrote so I could document my progress, and connect with a community of like-minded people who shared the same goals as me.\\n\\nOver time, I realized that my articles added value for people who were on the same journey as I was.\\n\\nAs I wrote more, what had initially started out as a hobby began to generate revenue.\\n\\nI was able to make passive income by simply writing about my experiences and posting them online.\\n\\nI am now a top writer in technology and artificial intelligence on Medium, which is more than anything I could’ve imagined.\\n\\n3. Affiliate marketing\\n\\nOnce I started learning data science on my own, I would share links to the courses I was taking on Medium and LinkedIn.\\n\\nHowever, it is only recently that I discovered affiliate marketing.\\n\\nWith affiliate marketing, you can share courses that you enjoyed with other people. If someone else clicks on the course link you shared, a small percentage of their course fee will go to you.\\n\\nI am yet to earn a lot from affiliate marketing, mainly because I am very selective about the courses I promote.\\n\\nI have taken almost all the courses I promote, and have done extensive research to compile the rest.\\n\\nSo this is a very small income stream, but I’m still adding it to this list.\\n\\n4. Freelancing\\n\\nLast year, I was looking for ways to make money online.\\n\\nI surveyed sites like Fiverr and Upwork to see if I’d be able to take up any gigs, since I really needed a new source of income.\\n\\nHowever, I felt like these platforms were overly competitive, and I didn’t really fit into any of the categories on these sites.\\n\\nAfter learning data science, I realized that there was a pretty big market for freelance data scientists.\\n\\nThere are many companies out there that don’t require an entire data science team, and hire people on a contract basis to build and deploy models for them.\\n\\nI’m currently working on a one-off machine learning project for a client, and I’m learning a lot along the way.\\n\\nI also get freelance offers from publishers and technical sites to write data science articles for them.\\n\\nAll my clients have reached out to me after reading my articles or my LinkedIn posts, which is why its a great idea to write data science articles on Medium and build a social media following.\\n\\nI’ve also recently started offering consultation sessions for people who are trying to learn data science or break into the industry, which is another source of my income. Again, I get most of my clients from my LinkedIn profile and Medium articles.',\n",

If it still feels like magic I strongly recommend you go ahead and read this blog:\\n\\nI’ll leave a TL;DR here: through my workout routines, learning human languages throughout my life, and maths (all of that on my own) I got skillful at learning. Coursera’s “Learning how to learn course” helped as well.\\n\\nNow that you have all of the necessary context let me tell you about the ML curriculum I followed to land a job at DeepMind!\\n\\nPart 2: ML curriculum (January 2020 — June 2021)\\n\\nNew Year 2020 came along. I just finished reading “Crushing it” from garyvee and decided I should start my own YouTube channel sharing my ML learning journey along the way.\\n\\nThe pandemic struck and I was in warp speed again. The stars aligned. ⭐\\n\\nI decided that over the next year I want to cover various subfields of AI, and I roughly decided that I want to dedicate 3 months to each one of these.\\n\\nBut things weren’t that smooth in the beginning, I was still figuring stuff out. My first subfield, neural style transfer (NST), took longer than 3 months because I found it enjoyable and I thought why rush it?\\n\\nAlong the way, I found a perfect strategy for myself.\\n\\nI structured my learning the following way. I had “macro” cycles (3-month periods where I tackle a new subfield) and I had multiple micro-cycles interspersed over macro.\\n\\nThe micro-cycles are of 2 types:\\n\\nInput mode : I’m ingesting information. The goal is to either get a high-level understanding of the structure of the subfield (blogs, videos) or an in-depth understanding of the topic at hand (research papers, books, etc.)\\n\\n: I’m ingesting information. The goal is to either get a high-level understanding of the structure of the subfield (blogs, videos) or an in-depth understanding of the topic at hand (research papers, books, etc.) Output mode: I’m sharing information I accumulated during my input mode. Teach others! Create public artifacts like YouTube videos, GitHub projects (1 project in the middle of macro), and blogs (1 blog at the end of a macro). As well as higher-frequency updates on LinkedIn. Much later I started sharing on Twitter and Discord as well.\\n\\nNow the tricky part was combining all of this with my full-time job at Microsoft! It took a significant amount of willpower. I’d hit the program as soon as I wake up for 2h, I’d go for a quick stroll, I’d do my job at Microsoft and a 30-minute power nap after I wrap it up, and finally I’d be working for additional 2–3 hours before going to sleep. The pandemic helped me maintain this crazy rhythm.\\n\\nTime management is a tricky part for many people (Photo by Lukas Blazek on Unsplash)\\n\\nThe time management and stress handling probably deserve a separate blog post, but it mostly boils down to willpower, correct mindset, as well as taking smart breaks (power naps are golden — let me know in the comments if you’d like a separate blog on the topic of time management).\\n\\nNow let me go into the specifics of the macros I did on my way to DeepMind! Luckily I started writing blogs sometime around my transformers macro so if you want to know all the nitty-gritty details and the strategy I took, I’ll link the blogs in every single macro section.\\n\\nFor the first 3 macros (NST, DeepDream, and GANs) I, unfortunately, didn’t write a dedicated blog, but the intro section of the transformers blog below as well as the YouTube videos and projects I created can fill in the gaps:\\n\\nHaving said that, here are the TL; DRs of every macro I did:\\n\\n[1] NST (Neural Style Transfer)\\n\\nDuring this period I was learning about neural style transfer. I ended up reading a pile of research papers (though a lot less than later when I became proficient), implementing 3 different projects, which I then open-sourced on my GitHub, and I made an NST playlist on YouTube.\\n\\nI think that this is a great topic to start with as it’s highly visual and visceral. I recently wrote some of my thoughts on a similar topic in this LinkedIn post. Also, digital image processing and computer vision were the fields I felt the most comfortable with and so that’s why this was a great starting point for me.\\n\\nI perfected my PyTorch knowledge, learned a lot about CNNs and optimization methods, improved my presentation skills (just check out those README files 😂), became more proficient at reading research papers, and improved my SE skills in general — to name a few.\\n\\nHere is an NST image synthesized using the code I wrote:\\n\\nYou can create this using my GitHub projects (all of my projects have an MIT license)\\n\\n[2] DeepDream\\n\\nEver since I first saw the pictures created with DeepDream I was fascinated. I knew I had to learn it. Every single detail. I couldn’t just use online generators and not understand what was going on.\\n\\nI was reading blogs, analyzing DeepDream subreddits, and exploring various codebases. Most of the original code was written in Torch & Lua combo. I remember losing a lot of time trying to set it up on Windows. Then I switched to Linux, got it to work, only to realize that I won’t be using that repo either way. 😂\\n\\nMy output was a single video on the theory behind DeepDream and an open-source project. I learned a lot by doing this and I enjoyed the process. I used my code to generate these beautiful images, among them the current visual identity of The AI Epiphany. Here is an example:\\n\\nDeepDream implementation I developed, you can create pics like this one using this code.\\n\\n[3] GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)\\n\\nGANs were still very popular in early 2020. I felt like I’m missing the necessary background and so I decided to tackle them next.\\n\\nI’ve read all of the seminal papers (as well as other less prominent papers) and I decided to implement vanilla GAN, cGAN (conditional GAN), and DCGAN models. Here is an output from the DCGAN model I trained:\\n\\nman -> woman (notice that the rotation and skin tone change as well)\\n\\nAt this point in time, I refined my strategy. I realized that:\\n\\nI need to write a blog at the end of each macro, summarizing what I’ve learned. That will help future Aleksas (and Aleksa from the future) tackle topic X.\\n\\nI need to cover papers on my YouTube channel as I’m reading them. A similar thought process — by doing this I’ll learn better and I’ll help others.\\n\\nI need to open-source a project in the middle of the macro. After you implement something you understand it way better — that was/is my thinking. After that, all the papers I read made more sense.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I don’t have GAN paper overviews from this period. Back then I was experimenting with videos such as “PyTorch or Tensorflow” which turned out to be the most popular ones (proving a hypothesis I had in my mind).\\n\\nBut I didn’t seek popularity (not that I would mind in general), I was seeking a highly relevant audience. I’d much rather have 1 guy/gal from “DeepMind” following my work than 100 beginners — because I knew what my goals are.\\n\\n[4] NLP & transformers\\n\\nI knew I wanted to learn more about BERT and the GPT family of models. Transformers were everywhere, and I didn’t quite understand them.\\n\\nThis time I did everything correctly and executed the plan I sketched above. I ended up implementing the original transformer paper from scratch and learned a ton! I decided to create an English-German machine translation system. Since I speak those languages, I thought that’ll make debugging easier, and it did.\\n\\nI’m so grateful I did it back then — every now and then you need to understand the QKV attention, and it’s second nature to me now. You can find out much more about this journey here:\\n\\n[5] Graph/Geometric ML\\n\\nGraph ML (by Tamas Nepusz, co-creator of igraph)\\n\\nEven before I started doing transformers I knew I wanted to dig deeper into Graph ML (before it became as popular as it is nowadays).\\n\\nAnd, in retrospect, I’m very glad I covered transformers/NLP first since the field of NLP had a huge influence on this field. GAT was directly inspired by the original transformer paper, DeepWalk by Word2Vec, and so on.\\n\\nAt this point in time, I was already chatting with Petar Veličković on a fairly regular basis (I’ll tell you a bit later more about how this came to be) and he knew that I’ll be covering GNNs in the next period. He was very receptive and he told me that I can ping him whenever I felt stuck!\\n\\nI realized that this is a great opportunity! I’ll be learning Graph ML, a topic that fascinated me and I’ll be communicating with Petar, a researcher at DeepMind, who was among the best researchers in this particular field.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I learned a lot! I made a “popular” YouTube GNN series that was shared by influential Graph ML researchers like Michael Bronstein, Petar, and others.\\n\\nI also made a popular PyTorch implementation of GAT (Petar is the first author of GAT). The reason it became so popular is that it was, according to others, the most beginner-friendly resource out there. With 2 Jupyter notebooks, PPI and Cora datasets support, a nice README, and accompanying videos it filled the gap and made it easy for beginners to enter the field.\\n\\n(It became a recommended repo for a Cambridge lecture on GNNs and I even got citations. 😅)\\n\\nI again massively used the fact that I could ping Petar if I had any problems and that this could be a great collaboration between the 2 of us!\\n\\nFor the whole story check out this blog:\\n\\n[6] RL (Reinforcement Learning)\\n\\nDrum roll. Surprise, surprise! I really wanted to learn RL either way but it so happens that DeepMind is famous for its RL breakthroughs. 😅\\n\\nThere were so many papers and projects I wanted to understand! Like AlphaGo, DQN, OpenAI’s robotic hand that could solve Rubik’s cube, etc.\\n\\nThis field proved to be very different compared to other ML subfields. The data point independence assumption doesn’t hold anymore, a random seed can make your agent fail to converge, etc.\\n\\nI’m very glad I already had a decent amount of experience before tackling RL, otherwise, I might have gotten demotivated. I started with stuff that’s very close to my heart — computer vision — and I used it to ramp up my ML knowledge. Then, I slowly progressed toward topics I knew little about.\\n\\nI again had some help here! Petar connected me with Charles Blundell (who’s also a DeepMinder) and so from time to time, I used that opportunity, although a lot more frugally.\\n\\nFor the whole story check out this blog:',\n",

Subtle, often invisible changes in the data can push our networks to make terrible mistakes. We, as human beings, seem to be way more resilient to these perturbations in our sensory inputs (though not totally immune).\\n\\nThere is a certain pattern in our deep learning systems. They achieve remarkable things, but they are also at times delicate and brittle. Like a rigid tree in the middle of a storm, they look majestic, but may crack at any time without warning. Why is this happening and how can we improve the situation?\\n\\nSome clarity is starting to appear through new research arriving from the field of neuroscience. In this article we are going to explore it.\\n\\nIn his recently published book, “A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence”, a masterpiece that I really enjoyed, scientist and entrepreneur Jeff Hawkins dissects the latest research performed by his team on our neocortex, the part of the brain that occupies 70% of its volume and is responsible for our advanced intelligence. (the other 30% is occupied by the older, more primitive part of the brain).\\n\\nIn a fascinating journey, Jeff Hawkins takes us deep into the epicenter of our intelligence. He shares that:\\n\\nThe circuits in the neocortex are really complex . In just one square millimeter we have around one hundred thousand neurons , several hundred thousand million connections (synapses) and kilometers of axons and dendrites.\\n\\nin the neocortex are . In just we have around , (synapses) and and dendrites. The neocortex looks very similar all around . The variations between areas are small.\\n\\n. The variations between areas are small. All parts of the neocortex seem to be connected to the generation of movement, to motor tasks. In every part of the neocortex, scientists find cells that connect with areas of the old brain related to movement.\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nOne circuit to rule them all\\n\\nVernon Mountcastle was a leading american neurophysiologist and professor emeritus of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins university. He was the discoverer of the columnar structure of the cortex. And he proposed that through evolution, our neocortex became larger by basically copying over and over the very same thing, the same basic circuit.\\n\\nWhen I read about Mountcastle’s idea in Jeff’s book, I got reminded of a fascinating talk by the great scientist Robert Sapolsky. Answering a question about what separates us from Chimps (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzDLkPFjev4), Sapolsky explains that about half of the difference in gene expression between chimps and humans has to do with genes that are coding for olfactory receptors, other differences are related to the size of the pelvic arch, the amount of body hair, immune system recognition capabilities, some aspects of reproductive isolation, etc; those and others account for almost all the genetic differences between chimps and humans. So then, where are the differences in the genes that are relevant to the human brain? Sapolsky explains that there is hardly any, and the few identified are in genes having to do with the number of rounds of cell division during fetal brain development. Basically: we have 3 times more neurons than chimps. And this difference in scale seems to be key to our advanced intelligence.\\n\\nThis fits nicely with Mountcastle’s idea of a single circuit that gets replicated many, many times (volume matters, but is volume enough to push today’s deep learning systems towards AGI? let’s keep exploring below).\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nThat all parts of our neocortex are working based on a similar principle, on the same basic circuit, fits the flexibility our brain has demonstrated in different scenarios. And if volume matters, will this mean that GPT-11 may get us closer to AGI?\\n\\nUnfortunately, it is not that simple. Because there is a massive elephant in the room that Jeff illuminates in his book and theory. One that we have been kind of ignoring for far too long.\\n\\n150000 columns\\n\\nBefore we go to visit the elephant in the room, let’s establish the context. According to the scientists, we have around 150000 cortical columns in our neocortex. Jeff tells us that we could think of these columns as if they were thin spaghetti. So, imagine 150000 thin spaghetti next to each other. That’s your neocortex metaphorically speaking.\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nWhat is going on within these cortical columns? Over the last years scientists have come to realize that the brain is a predictive machine. It produces a model of the world and continuously predicts what will happen next.\\n\\nWhen our brain’s predictions are not correct, we realize that something is not right and our brain updates its model of the world. As time goes on, our model of the world gets richer and more sophisticated.\\n\\nSo in a way we indeed live in a simulation. For what we perceive is really the model that the brain constructs rather than the “reality” out there. This explains phantom limbs and other similar scenarios.\\n\\nJeff Hawkins points out that our brain learns a model of the world by paying attention to how the inputs it receives change as we move (or as those inputs move). And that takes us to the elephant in the room.\\n\\nThe elephant in the room\\n\\nThe world is changing constantly. Everything moves. And it makes sense that as things move and change, our brain keeps updating our model of the world (our many, many models as we will soon see).\\n\\nAnd just as attention mechanisms have revolutionized the deep learning field in recent years, so is attention key in how our brain is learning these models.\\n\\nBut if our neocortex is making a very large amount of predictions constantly, and adapting to any misalignments between its models and what it perceives, why don’t we notice all of those predictions and instead we perceive one continuous reality? Let’s get there, step by step.\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nThrough their latest research, Jeff and his team reach some fascinating insights:\\n\\nEach of our cortical columns (150000 roughly) is learning models of the world , of objects, of concepts, of anything you could imagine. And just as our old brain has place cells and grid cells to make models of our surroundings, the neocortex , they propose, has equivalent cells that allow the brain to make models of objects, concepts , etc. The cortical columns are using what Jeff calls reference frames , which are like grids of a number of dimensions that help the brain organize any kind of knowledge .\\n\\n(150000 roughly) , of objects, of concepts, of anything you could imagine. And just as our has and to make models of our surroundings, the , they propose, , etc. The cortical columns what Jeff calls , which are like grids of a number of dimensions that . Jeff tells us that thinking is a form of movement. Thinking happens when we change location within these reference frames. So what you are thinking right now, what is right now in your head, depends on where your cortical columns are at the moment within those different reference frames. And your thoughts keep evolving as your brain navigates those structures.\\n\\nNotice that the concept of movement is beginning to appear everywhere. Movement and the dynamic nature of systems are the elephant in the room. And we will soon discuss how that connects with the issue of adversarial examples and the limitations of much of what’s going on in today’s deep learning.\\n\\nSo, it is all about reference frames or maps, maps of physical spaces, maps of concepts, maps of anything. Jeff tells us that in the same way that reference frames in the old brain are learning maps of different environments, reference frames in the neocortex are learning maps of objects (in the case of what they call “what” columns), or the space around the body (in the case of “where” columns), or maps of concepts within the non-sensory columns.\\n\\nI love the analogy that Jeff uses regarding how in order to be an expert in any domain we need to find a good way to organize our knowledge about that domain, we need to create internally a great reference frame or map of that domain. Think of the deep and complex reference frames that, for example, Leonardo Da Vinci or Einstein had in order to excel as they did within their respective areas of expertise.\\n\\nAll right, so each of our 150000 cortical columns is learning a predictive model of the world as it pays attention to how the inputs change throughout time. And each of these columns learns models of a large number of elements, objects, concepts, etc.\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nSo our knowledge of anything, an object or a concept, is distributed across thousands of cortical columns, across thousands of complementary models. This relates to the name of Jeff’s theory (A thousand brains).\\n\\nAnd all of this connects with the flexible nature of our brain. Our neocortex doesn’t depend on a single column. Knowledge is distributed across thousands of them. So the brain continues working even if an injury damages a set of columns (there are great examples about this in the academic literature).\\n\\nThe next thing to consider is: if the brain is creating new predictions everytime movement happens, where are these predictions being stored?\\n\\nJeff and his team propose that spikes that occur at different dendrites in a neuron are predictions (dendrites are branches in the neuron, and receive inputs through their synapses). Dendrite spikes put the cell connected to them into what Jeff calls a predictive state. Therefore, predictions happen inside neurons. And these predictions change the electrical properties of the neuron and make it fire sooner than it would otherwise, but the predictions are not sent through the axon to other neurons, which explains why we are not aware of most of them. The question now is: how do we settle on a specific prediction?\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nConsensus by voting\\n\\nOur perception of reality is the result of a voting process. The different cortical columns reach consensus through voting and this is what produces a single perception that unifies different predictions coming from different parts of the system (that may also be related to a diversity of types of sensory inputs).\\n\\nOnly some cells need to vote, the ones that represent, for example, a specific object that we are perceiving. And how do they vote?\\n\\nMost of the connections in our cortical columns are going up and down the different layers of the neocortex. But there are exceptions. Scientists have found that there are cells that send their axons (output connections) from side to side through the neocortex. Jeff and his team propose that these cells that have long distance connections are the ones responsible for the voting.\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nAs we recognize an object, our cortical columns have reached a consensus on what it is that we are looking at. The voting cells (neurons) in each of our columns make a stable pattern that represents that object and where the object is located in relation to us.\\n\\nAnd as long as we keep perceiving the same object, the state of those voting neurons doesn’t change while we keep interacting with that element. Other neurons will change their state as we move or the object moves, but the voting neurons will remain stable.\\n\\nPainting by the author Javier Ideami@ideami.com\\n\\nThis is why our perception is stable and we are not aware of the flurry of activity related to the moving predictions that are taking place. We are just aware of the final stable patterns that arise from the consensus reached by the cells that are voting.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\nMovement is key in how our brain perceives the world. It is thanks to movement (our own or the one of the world around us) that our brain can enrich its internal models of objects and concepts (movement doesn’t have to be physical, it can be virtual, etc).\\n\\nin the world. It is thanks to movement (our own or the one of the world around us) that of objects and concepts (movement doesn’t have to be physical, it can be virtual, etc). Using a single principle to process all kinds of inputs and creating thousands of predictions and models for each element we interact with, makes these models rich and versatile .\\n\\nand creating element we interact with, makes these . The consensus mechanism reached through voting means that our perception of the world is stable and at the same time flexible and resilient.\\n\\nIt is time to return to the adversarial examples and the status of the deep learning field.\\n\\nHow to defeat adversarial examples\\n\\nHuman beings are not immune to adversarial examples. Perturbations in our sensory inputs can confuse us and make us interpret things incorrectly. Most of us have experienced a wide range of optical illusions. However, in general, our perception is consistent and quite resilient, and certainly way more consistent than the one we find in today’s deep learning systems, where invisible changes can derail completely our results.\\n\\nWhat is behind this resiliency, consistency and flexibility? Whatever it is, it may include some of the following:\\n\\nThe models created by our cortical columns are based on movement and the creation of reference frames. As we move around or the world moves around us, our brain creates thousands of predictions and models of each object or concept . This provides flexibility . We are not putting all our eggs in one basket. Just as when we use ensembling in deep learning, we are betting on thousands of angles on the problem, not just one.\\n\\ncreated by our cortical columns are As we move around or the world moves around us, our . This provides . We are not putting all our eggs in one basket. Just as when we use ensembling in deep learning, we are on the problem, not just one. Our perception is based on multimodality and stable voting dynamics. The different models created in relation to a specific object (or concept, etc), are using multiple predictions that are often connected to different sensory modalities (vision, touch, hearing, gestures, etc). Voting among the cells that are responsible for the final representations produces stable patterns that are resilient to changes. A minimal change in the object or context will not derail the stable voting pattern because such a pattern is based on the combination of thousands of separate predictions, which in turn are based on a combination of many different angles, perspectives and also, often, different sensory modalities. Just as ensembling often wins in Kaggle competitions, it is also a kind of ensemble that is taking place in the brain, making our human perception stable, resilient and flexible (relatively speaking of course, but especially so in comparison with current deep learning systems).\\n\\nSo, “the end” of adversarial examples in deep learning, and by “end” I don’t mean absolute end, just getting to a level of resiliency, consistency and flexibility similar to the one we have as human beings, will be possible with a combination of:\\n\\nMovement : physical or virtual. Deep learning systems need to be able to gather different perspectives and angles on the world by enriching their internal models as they move or as the world moves around them. Robotics and AI will have to merge further . Beyond robotics, movement can also be virtual so this principle goes beyond the physical .\\n\\n: physical or virtual. to be able to by as they move or as the world moves around them. . Beyond robotics, so this principle . A collection of models: we have to go beyond single representations or models. To become resilient to adversarial examples and other challenges, deep learning needs to generate a large amount of predictions and models that get updated continuously. A voting mechanism can then create stable patterns and representations that will be way more resilient to adversarial perturbations.\\n\\nwe have to To become resilient to adversarial examples and other challenges, deep learning needs to A can then that will be way more resilient to adversarial perturbations. Continuous learning: The world out there is not waiting. A consequence of the above is that learning needs to be continuous. Deep learning systems are too static nowadays. Continuous learning is an active area of research and its importance will only increase going forwards.\\n\\nThe world out there is not waiting. A consequence of the above is that systems are nowadays. Continuous learning is an active area of research and its importance will only increase going forwards. Reference frames: We can find much inspiration about how to build our representations and models from the reference frames described by Jeff Hawkins in his book and theory. As Jeff points out, deep learning leaders like Geoffrey Hinton have already been working for quite some time in trying to make deep learning models more flexible (see capsule networks). But there is still a long road ahead and it is becoming clear that the latest neuroscience research is reinforcing that direction with new hints; our brain is way more flexible and resilient than our deep learning models and now we are beginning to understand why.\\n\\nResearching new ways of detecting adversarial examples is an interesting area with much academic activity. What is missing now is to rethink our deep learning architectures and systems to transition from the current static paradigm to a dynamic one based on multi-modal, multi-model, consensus-based predictive systems that are resilient, consistent and flexible. When we reach that point, we will be able to hide or perturb parts of our systems and still maintain stable predictions.\\n\\nAs Jeff points out, this will become more and more crucial as we try to apply AI systems to scenarios that require a lot of flexibility and resilience.\\n\\nMountcastle’s ideas, Sapolsky’s thoughts and our fascination about the GPT architecture, all of those things indicate the importance of volume. Volume matters. Having 3 times more neurons, or thousands of copies of the same basic circuit, or hundreds of billions of parameters rather than 1 billion, all of that matters.\\n\\nAnd that’s good news for the current state of the deep learning field. With projects such as the GPT system, we are discovering and confirming that fact, that volume matters.\\n\\nBut, what we are also beginning to realize is that, as much as volume matters, it will not be enough to take us where we wanna go.\\n\\nIf you follow the latest conversations about systems like GPT-3 in a range of podcasts and venues, say for example at the machine learning street talk podcast, you will hear similar conclusions.

              "   \"Do Not Use Print For Debugging In Python Anymore\\n\\nWhat is the most frequently used function in Python? Well, probably in most of the programming languages, it has to be the print() function. I believe most of the developers like me, would use it to print messages into the console many times during the development.\\n\\nOf course, there is no alternative that can completely replace the print() function. However, when we want to output something for debugging purposes, there are definitely better ways of doing so. In this article, I’m going to introduce a very interesting 3rd party library in Python called “Ice Cream”. It could create lots of conveniences for quick and easy debugging.\\n\\nA Bad Example\\n\\nImage by Krzysztof Pluta from Pixabay\\n\\nLet’s start with a relatively bad example. Suppose we have defined a function and we want to see whether it works as expected.\\n\\ndef square_of(num):\\n\\nreturn num*num\\n\\nThis function simply returns the square of the number passed in as an argument. We may want to test it multiple times as follows.\\n\\nprint(square_of(2))\\n\\nprint(square_of(3))\\n\\nprint(square_of(4))\\n\\nThis is OK for now. However, we will have much more lines of code in practice. Also, there could be many print() functions that print different things into the output area. In this case, sometimes we may be confused about which output is generated by which print() function.\\n\\nTherefore, it is a good manner to add some brief description to the content of the print() function to remind us what it is about.\\n\\nprint('square of 2:', square_of(2))\\n\\nprint('square of 3:', square_of(3))\\n\\nprint('square of 4:', square_of(4))\\n\\nIt is much better now, but it is too tiring to do this every time. Also, when we finish the development, very likely have to remove most of the debugging prints.\\n\\nBasic Usage — Inspect Variables\\n\\nImage by StockSnap from Pixabay\\n\\nLet’s have a look at the Ice Cream library. How it solves the problems that were mentioned above?\\n\\nFirst of all, we need to install it from the PyPI repository simply using pip .\\n\\npip install icecream\\n\\nThen, let’s import the library as follows.\\n\\nfrom icecream import ic\\n\\nNow, we can use it for everything we want to print as debug information.\\n\\nCall a Function\\n\\nWe can directly use ice cream to print a function just like what we have done using the print() function previously.\\n\\nic(square_of(2))\\n\\nic(square_of(3))\\n\\nic(square_of(4))\\n\\nGreat! We never specify anything in the ic() function, but it automatically outputs the function name and argument together with the outcome. So, we don’t have to manually add the “brief description” anymore.\\n\\nAccess a Dictionary\\n\\nNot only calling a function, but Ice Cream can also output everything verbose that is convenient for debugging purpose, such as accessing a key-value pair of a dictionary.\\n\\nmy_dict = {\\n\\n'name': 'Chris',\\n\\n'age': 33\\n\\n} ic(my_dict['name'])\\n\\nIn this example, I have defined a dictionary and try to access a value in it from its key. The Ice Cream output both the variable name of the dictionary and the key that I was accessing.\\n\\nAccess Attributes of an Object\\n\\nOne more example, let’s define a class and instantiate an object from it.\\n\\nclass Dog():\\n\\nnum_legs = 4\\n\\ntail = True dog = Dog()\\n\\nNow, let’s use Ice Cream to output an attribute of it.\\n\\nic(dog.tail)\\n\\nDebug in If-Condition\\n\\nImage by silviarita from Pixabay\\n\\nThe Ice Cream library is not only useful for inspecting a variable, but also in a control statement such as an if-condition. For example, let’s write a simple if-else condition as follows.\\n\\ninput = 'Chris' if input == 'Chris':\\n\\nic()\\n\\nelse:\\n\\nic()\\n\\nWe just put the Ice Cream function in the if and else blocks, see what happen.\\n\\nAlthough the if-else statement does nothing at the moment, the ic() function still tells us where and when it has been called, as well as the line number.\\n\\nBTW, I’m using Python Notebooks for this demo. If this is running in a “.py” file, it will also tell us the file name that it was called from.\\n\\nLet’s consider a more practical usage as follows.\\n\\ndef check_user(username):\\n\\nif username == 'Chris':\\n\\n# do something\\n\\nic()\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n# do something else\\n\\nic() check_user('Chris')\\n\\ncheck_user('Jade')\\n\\nThe function will do something for different user. For debugging purposes, we always want to know which is the current user. Then, the ic() function will always tell us that.\\n\\nInsert Into Existing Code\\n\\nImage by StockSnap from Pixabay\\n\\nThis cool feature of the Ice Cream library needs to be highlighted in my opinion. That is, the ic() function will not only output the verbose information but also pass the value through so that it can be a wrap of anything. In other words, we can put the ic() function to anything in our code without affecting it.\\n\\nLet’s keep using the sqaure_of() function that we defined in the previous section.\\n\\nnum = 2 square_of_num = square_of(ic(num))\\n\\nIn this example, suppose we have a variable num and we want to calculate its square. Instead of square_of(num) , I put the ic() function out of the variable num . Therefore, the value of the variable num is printed, and the result assigned to square_of_num will not be affected.\\n\\nWe can test the result as follows.\\n\\nif ic(square_of_num) == pow(num, 2):\\n\\nic('Correct!')\\n\\nTherefore, square_of_num equals to the square of the variable num . Also, in this if-condition, I also used the ic() function without affecting the purpose, but the variable square_of_num is printed for debugging!\\n\\nDisable Ice Cream\\n\\nImage by Free-Photos from Pixabay\\n\\nOne of the biggest issue when using the print() function for debugging is that there are too many of them. It is very common that we have them everywhere when we finished the development. Then, it would be a disaster if we want to clean our code to remove them.\\n\\nIf we’re using the Ice Cream library for debugging, what we need to do is simply disable it.\\n\\nic.disable()\\n\\nAfter that, all the ic() function will stop output anything. For example, the code below will output nothing.\\n\\nYou may ask that how about the variable square_of_num ? Will it still be passed through if we disabled the Ice Cream function? Don’t worry, the disabling feature will only disable the output, we don’t need to worry about any other features.\\n\\nif ic(square_of_num) == pow(num, 2):\\n\\nprint('Correct!')\\n\\nIf we change the output back to the print() function, it still can be output. That means the ic(square_of_num) still equivalent to square_of_num .\\n\\nOf course, if we want to go back to the debug mode, the Ice Cream can be re-enabled.\\n\\nic.enable()\\n\\nCustomising Ice Creame Output\\n\\nImage by Jan Vašek from Pixabay\\n\\nThe Ice Cream can also be customised for its output. The most commonly used customisation would be changing the prefix. You may have noticed that the default output always has the prefix ic | . Yes, we can customise it.\\n\\nFor example, we can change it to Debug | which makes more sense for its debugging purpose.\\n\\nic.configureOutput(prefix='Debug | ')\\n\\nic('test')\\n\\nIn fact, rather than a static string, the prefix can also be set to a function. For example, let’s define a function that returns the current timestamp in a formatted string.\\n\\nfrom datetime import datetime def now():\\n\\nreturn f'[{datetime.now()}] '\\n\\nThen, we can set that function as the Ice Cream prefix.\\n\\nic.configureOutput(prefix=now)\\n\\nic('test')\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nImage by Seksak Kerdkanno from Pixabay\\n\\nIn this article, I have introduced an awesome 3rd party library for Python called “Ice Cream”. It enhanced the regular print() function of Python with verbose output. Therefore, it makes debugging very convenient.\\n\\nThe Ice Cream library will never replace the print() function, because it is designed for debugging purposes. Also, it does not mean to replace the logging system as well. In my opinion, it is in between these two.

              "   '9 Distance Measures in Data Science\\n\\nDistance Measures. Image by the author.\\n\\nMany algorithms, whether supervised or unsupervised, make use of distance measures. These measures, such as euclidean distance or cosine similarity, can often be found in algorithms such as k-NN, UMAP, HDBSCAN, etc.\\n\\nUnderstanding the field of distance measures is more important than you might realize. Take k-NN for example, a technique often used for supervised learning. As a default, it often uses euclidean distance. By itself, a great distance measure.\\n\\nHowever, what if your data is highly dimensional? Would euclidean distance then still work? Or what if your data consists of geospatial information? Perhaps haversine distance would then be a better alternative!\\n\\nKnowing when to use which distance measure can help you go from a poor classifier to an accurate model.\\n\\nIn this article, we will go through many distance measures and explore how and when they best can be used. Most importantly, I will be talking about their disadvantages so that you can recognize when to steer clear of certain measures.\\n\\nNOTE: For most distance measures long elaborate papers could and have been written on their use-cases, advantages, and disadvantages. I will try to cover as much as possible but may fall short! Thus, consider this article a global overview of these measures.\\n\\n1. Euclidean Distance\\n\\nEuclidean distance. Image by the author.\\n\\nWe start with the most common distance measure, namely Euclidean distance. It is a distance measure that best can be explained as the length of a segment connecting two points.\\n\\nThe formula is rather straightforward as the distance is calculated from the cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem.\\n\\nEuclidean distance\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nAlthough it is a common distance measure, Euclidean distance is not scale in-variant which means that distances computed might be skewed depending on the units of the features. Typically, one needs to normalize the data before using this distance measure.\\n\\nMoreover, as the dimensionality increases of your data, the less useful Euclidean distance becomes. This has to do with the curse of dimensionality which relates to the notion that higher-dimensional space does not act as we would, intuitively, expect from 2- or 3-dimensional space. For a good summary, see this post.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nEuclidean distance works great when you have low-dimensional data and the magnitude of the vectors is important to be measured. Methods like kNN and HDBSCAN show great results out of the box if Euclidean distance is used on low-dimensional data.\\n\\nAlthough many other measures have been developed to account for the disadvantages of Euclidean distance, it is still one of the most used distance measures for good reasons. It is incredibly intuitive to use, simple to implement and shows great results in many use-cases.\\n\\n2. Cosine Similarity\\n\\nCosine distance. Image by the author.\\n\\nCosine similarity has often been used as a way to counteract Euclidean distance’s problem with high dimensionality. The cosine similarity is simply the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It also has the same inner product of the vectors if they were normalized to both have length one.\\n\\nTwo vectors with exactly the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, whereas two vectors diametrically opposed to each other have a similarity of -1. Note that their magnitude is not of importance as this is a measure of orientation.\\n\\nCosine Similarity\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nOne main disadvantage of cosine similarity is that the magnitude of vectors is not taken into account, merely their direction. In practice, this means that the differences in values are not fully taken into account. If you take a recommender system, for example, then the cosine similarity does not take into account the difference in rating scale between different users.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nWe use cosine similarity often when we have high-dimensional data and when the magnitude of the vectors is not of importance. For text analyses, this measure is quite frequently used when the data is represented by word counts. For example, when a word occurs more frequently in one document over another this does not necessarily mean that one document is more related to that word. It could be the case that documents have uneven lengths and the magnitude of the count is of less importance. Then, we can best be using cosine similarity which disregards magnitude.\\n\\n3. Hamming Distance\\n\\nHamming distance. Image by the author.\\n\\nHamming distance is the number of values that are different between two vectors. It is typically used to compare two binary strings of equal length. It can also be used for strings to compare how similar they are to each other by calculating the number of characters that are different from each other.\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nAs you might expect, hamming distance is difficult to use when two vectors are not of equal length. You would want to compare same-length vectors with each other in order to understand which positions do not match.\\n\\nMoreover, it does not take the actual value into account as long as they are different or equal. Therefore, it is not advised to use this distance measure when the magnitude is an important measure.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nTypical use cases include error correction/detection when data is transmitted over computer networks. It can be used to determine the number of distorted bits in a binary word as a way to estimate error.\\n\\nMoreover, you can also use Hamming distance to measure the distance between categorical variables.\\n\\n4. Manhattan Distance\\n\\nManhattan distance. Image by the author.\\n\\nThe Manhattan distance, often called Taxicab distance or City Block distance, calculates the distance between real-valued vectors. Imagine vectors that describe objects on a uniform grid such as a chessboard. Manhattan distance then refers to the distance between two vectors if they could only move right angles. There is no diagonal movement involved in calculating the distance.\\n\\nManhattan distance\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nAlthough Manhattan distance seems to work okay for high-dimensional data, it is a measure that is somewhat less intuitive than euclidean distance, especially when using in high-dimensional data.\\n\\nMoreover, it is more likely to give a higher distance value than euclidean distance since it does not the shortest path possible. This does not necessarily give issues but is something you should take into account.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nWhen your dataset has discrete and/or binary attributes, Manhattan seems to work quite well since it takes into account the paths that realistically could be taken within values of those attributes. Take Euclidean distance, for example, would create a straight line between two vectors when in reality this might not actually be possible.\\n\\n5. Chebyshev Distance\\n\\nChebyshev distance. Image by the author.\\n\\nChebyshev distance is defined as the greatest of difference between two vectors along any coordinate dimension. In other words, it is simply the maximum distance along one axis. Due to its nature, it is often referred to as Chessboard distance since the minimum number of moves needed by a king to go from one square to another is equal to Chebyshev distance.\\n\\nChebyshev distance\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nChebyshev is typically used in very specific use-cases, which makes it difficult to use as an all-purpose distance metric, like Euclidean distance or Cosine similarity. For that reason, it is suggested to only use it when you are absolutely sure it suits your use-case.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nAs mentioned before, Chebyshev distance can be used to extract the minimum number of moves needed by aking to go from one square to another. Moreover, it can be a useful measure in games that allow unrestricted 8-way movement.\\n\\nIn practice, Chebyshev distance is often used in warehouse logistics as it closely resembles the time an overhead crane takes to move an object.\\n\\n6. Minkowski\\n\\nMinkowski distance. Image by the author.\\n\\nMinkowski distance is a bit more intricate measure than most. It is a metric used in Normed vector space (n-dimensional real space), which means that it can be used in a space where distances can be represented as a vector that has a length.\\n\\nThis measure has three requirements:\\n\\nZero Vector — The zero vector has a length of zero whereas every other vector has a positive length. For example, if we travel from one place to another, then that distance is always positive. However, if we travel from one place to itself, then that distance is zero.\\n\\n— The zero vector has a length of zero whereas every other vector has a positive length. For example, if we travel from one place to another, then that distance is always positive. However, if we travel from one place to itself, then that distance is zero. Scalar Factor — When you multiple the vector with a positive number its length is changed whilst keeping its direction. For example, if we go a certain distance in one direction and add the same distance, the direction does not change.\\n\\n— When you multiple the vector with a positive number its length is changed whilst keeping its direction. For example, if we go a certain distance in one direction and add the same distance, the direction does not change. Triangle Inequality — The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\\n\\nThe formula for the Minkowski distance is shown below:\\n\\nMinkowski distance\\n\\nMost interestingly about this distance measure is the use of parameter p . We can use this parameter to manipulate the distance metrics to closely resemble others.\\n\\nCommon values of p are:\\n\\np=1 — Manhattan distance\\n\\np=2 — Euclidean distance\\n\\np=∞ — Chebyshev distance\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nMinkowski has the same disadvantages as the distance measures they represent, so a good understanding of metrics like Manhattan, Euclidean, and Chebyshev distance is extremely important.\\n\\nMoreover, the parameter p can actually be troublesome to work with as finding the right value can be quite computationally inefficient depending on your use-case.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nThe upside to p is the possibility to iterate over it and find the distance measure that works best for your use case. It allows you a huge amount of flexibility over your distance metric, which can be a huge benefit if you are closely familiar with p and many distance measures.\\n\\n7. Jaccard Index\\n\\nJaccard index. Image by the author.\\n\\nThe Jaccard index (or Intersection over Union) is a metric used to calculate the similarity and diversity of sample sets. It is the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets.\\n\\nIn practice, it is the total number of similar entities between sets divided by the total number of entities. For example, if two sets have 1 entity in common and there are 5 different entities in total, then the Jaccard index would be 1/5 = 0.2.\\n\\nTo calculate the Jaccard distance we simply subtract the Jaccard index from 1:\\n\\nJaccard distance\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nA major disadvantage of the Jaccard index is that it is highly influenced by the size of the data. Large datasets can have a big impact on the index as it could significantly increase the union whilst keeping the intersection similar.\\n\\nUse-Cases\\n\\nThe Jaccard index is often used in applications where binary or binarized data are used. When you have a deep learning model predicting segments of an image, for instance, a car, the Jaccard index can then be used to calculate how accurate that predicted segment given true labels.\\n\\nSimilarly, it can be used in text similarity analysis to measure how much word choice overlap there is between documents. Thus, it can be used to compare sets of patterns.\\n\\n8. Haversine\\n\\nHaversine distance. Image by the author.\\n\\nHaversine distance is the distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. It is very similar to Euclidean distance in that it calculates the shortest line between two points. The main difference is that no straight line is possible since the assumption here is that the two points are on a sphere.\\n\\nHaversine distance between two points\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nOne disadvantage of this distance measure is that it is assumed the points lie on a sphere. In practice, this is seldom the case as, for example, the earth is not perfectly round which could make calculation in certain cases difficult. Instead, it would be interesting to look towards Vincenty distance which assumes an ellipsoid instead.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nAs you might have expected, Haversine distance is often used in navigation. For example, you can use it to calculate the distance between two countries when flying between them. Note that it is much less suited if the distances by themselves are already not that large. The curvature will not have that large of an impact.\\n\\n9. Sørensen-Dice Index\\n\\nSørensen–Dice coefficient. Image by the author.\\n\\nThe Sørensen-Dice index is very similar to Jaccard index in that it measures the similarity and diversity of sample sets. Although they are calculated similarly the Sørensen-Dice index is a bit more intuitive because it can be seen as the percentage of overlap between two sets, which is a value between 0 and 1:\\n\\nSørensen–Dice coefficient\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nLike the Jaccard index, they both overstate the importance of sets with little to no ground truth positive sets. As a result, it could dominate the average score taken over multiple sets. It weights each item inversely proportionally to the size of the relevant set rather than treating them equally.\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nThe use cases are similar, if not the same, as Jaccard index. You will find it typically used in either image segmentation tasks or text similarity analyses.\\n\\nNOTE: There are many more distance measures than the 9 mentioned here. If you are looking for more interesting metrics, I would suggest you look into one of the following: Mahalanobis, Canberra, Braycurtis, and KL-divergence.\\n\\nThank you for reading!\\n\\nIf you are, like me, passionate about AI, Data Science, or Psychology, please feel free to add me on LinkedIn or follow me on Twitter.',\n",

This is evidenced by the increasing popularity of no code, autoML solutions such as Data Robot, Rapid Miner and Alteryx.\\n\\nWhat Does This Mean?\\n\\nData scientists will be extinct in 10 years (give or take), or at least the role title will be. Going forward, the skill set collectively known as data science will be borne by a new generation of data savvy business specialists and subject matter experts who are able to imbue analysis with their deep domain knowledge, irrespective of whether they can code or not. Their titles will reflect their expertise rather than the means by which they demonstrate it, be it compliance specialists, product managers or investment analysts. We don’t need to look back far to find historic precedents. During the advent of the spreadsheet, data entry specialists were highly coveted, but nowadays, as Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (the author of “Storytelling With Data”) aptly observes, proficiency with Microsoft Office suite is a bare minimum. Before that, the ability to touch type with a typewriter was considered a specialist skill, however with the accessibility of personal computing it has also become assumed.\\n\\nLastly, for those considering a career in data science or commencing their studies, it may serve you well to constantly refer back to the Venn diagram that you will undoubtedly come across. It describes data science as an confluence of statistics, programming and domain knowledge. Despite each occupying an equal share of the intersecting area, some may warrant a higher weighting than others.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Views are my own, based on my observations and experiences.

As with any low-code tool, Xatkit helps you to define chatbots minimizing the amount of code you need to write. But it doesn’t completely remove it. You still need to have some basic tech skills to create your bot.\\n\\nNow, Xatkit is becoming also a no-code tool that enables you to create a chatbot with absolutely zero code. Even more, Xatkit is not only a no-code tool but also a no-learn one. Meaning that, instead of forcing you to learn a new interface to define your bots, you can just use Excel for your chatbot definitions. Creating bots doesn’t get easier than this!. As you can see in this demo, even the chatbot we have on Xatkit’s homepage has been fully generated from an Excel file.\\n\\nYou have all the details about this new Excel to chatbot service we’re offering on this page. We hope you find it useful. We do believe it really helps to democratize the creation of chatbots by bringing the chatbot definition process as close as possible to the end-user. And nothing more universal than a spreadsheet 🙂 . No need to code, no need to learn. If you know Excel, you can define your own bot!. Fill the template and in a couple of days we’ll get back to you with a ready-to-test bot. We’ll use this time to validate your bot definition, create and deploy the bot and do some internal testing before showing it to you. We’ll also take some notes on potential improvements in the bot definition that we can fix together before releasing your bot to the world.\\n\\nOf course, you cannot create just any bot. This is an obvious trade-off if you impose the condition of writing zero-code to define the chatbot. Right now we’re focusing on Question & Answer bots but we’re working on other powerful templates that offer more flexibility while sticking to the no-code paradigm.\\n\\nTrending Bot Articles:\\n\\nAnd we also plan to go beyond Excel files or, in fact, any kind of spreadsheets. If you have your bot defined somewhere/somehow, feel free to reach out with whatever you have and we’ll see how we can derive a chatbot from it, always looking to minimize your time investment. From our conversations with potential clients, we have realized that this initial effort to define the bot is one of the major factors that stop people from creating (and benefitting from) bots. At Xatkit, our commitment is to lower the barriers to entry to the chatbot world!\\n\\nDon’t forget to give us your 👏 !',\n",

              "   'What are key benefits for the FDA providing a consistent, clear approval process for products?\\n\\nNew Products\\n\\nIn my work on medical AI, I saw the great lengths researchers go to create superb models. Yet, an undefined regulatory framework limits the number who apply deep learning to solve medical problems and fewer yet who commercial those technologies.\\n\\nWe’re seeing an explosion in the uses of deep learning. Models can save lives, increase accessibility, reduce costs, and improve patient care. A clear pathway to market encourages innovation in medical AI.\\n\\nPhoto by Ramón Salinero on Unsplash\\n\\nBetter Models\\n\\nThe medical literature is filled with examples of how diverse datasets results in better models. This is true of classical medical methods before machine learning, and AI has the potential to improve or reduce medical biases.\\n\\nI have written about how diverse datasets can improve predictions across race, income, and education level. This is also true across other demographics–for example, a recent Stanford study showed that data for image-based AI models primarily came from California, Massachusetts, and New York. Patients in those states don’t represent everyone in the United States. Ensuring engineers train models across locations would create models that work for every patient.\\n\\nA set of best practices based on input from top researchers would also improve models. For example, if engineers use the test data during any step in the model’s creation before testing, it is less likely the model will work beyond its initial dataset.\\n\\nA set of clear guidelines will ensure all AI products coming to market result in models that don’t just work on paper — they actually work.\\n\\nWidespread Use\\n\\nWithout regulation providing a framework to create trust in efficacy and safety, use of medical AI products is limited.\\n\\nPhoto by Owen Beard on Unsplash\\n\\nWhy did you take antibiotics last time you were sick? Or the last prescription your doctor prescribed?\\n\\nThe aim in regulatory agencies is to ensure products work and are safe. Doing so means that more people will feel comfortable engaging with AI, whether with a cancer-detection algorithm or a surgical assistant for doctors.\\n\\nPerformance Monitoring\\n\\nRight now, there is no standard for monitoring an AI product post-approval. For non-AI medical devices, post-market safety monitoring exists. The FDA cannot use the same standard for AI products, which adapt quicker. However, there needs to be a standard.\\n\\nThis will help answer questions like:\\n\\nWhat if your AI product is not effective in real-world settings?\\n\\nIs your model still effective as you continue updating and training it?\\n\\nUnder what conditions do you need to reapply for approval (e.g. what if your product switches from highlighting X-rays for radiologists to identifying conditions)?\\n\\nTo be clear, deep learning models adapt and develop quicker than many drugs and traditional technologies. But we need to understand what the change process looks like after approval. And we need to create a process to monitor performance and safety.\\n\\nPatient Privacy\\n\\nMany medical providers use AI systems to assist decision-making without informing patients. A common rationale is that they use these tools for operations, not research. However, in traditional settings, unproven drugs require patient consent to take part in approved, monitored studies.\\n\\nRight now, what defines operations versus research is subjective. Concerns over collecting patient data seem to be increasing as well, with cases like Ascension’s alleged sale of identifiable patient data to Google. Defining protocols around what defines research and how to collect patient data would reduce risk for patients and companies.\\n\\nReduced Cost\\n\\nRight now, companies have minimal incentive to gather and diversify their data, safeguard models, and take other actions to improve their products. Why? There is no framework. If the FDA issues a framework that all companies must follow, they will take on the expense of doing so–and reduce their costs in the long run.\\n\\nUncertainty around approval adds cost. If companies apply through an official process, it can be cheaper than informally communicating with teams at the FDA. The requirements and timeline would be clearer. This reduces the cost for companies and the FDA. And ultimately, patients.\\n\\nStability\\n\\nIn the Trump administration’s last days, it filed a proposal to exempt permanently many medical AI categories from FDA review. A few weeks later, the Biden administration put the proposal on hold. The fate of medical AI should not change whenever national politics changes.\\n\\nWhile adaptability is key in this new domain, we should have an established, stable standard for AI medical products–just like we do with non-AI medical products.',\n",

As a result, a classifier trained on a particular user might generalise poorly to data recorded at a different time on the same individual.\\n\\nEEG signals are highly user-specific, as such, most BCI systems are calibrated for each user. In research by Georgia Institute of Technology, they obtained 38% accuracy on unseen subjects (not part of the training dataset) and 75% on seen subjects.\\n\\nHajinoroozi et al. tested both within-subject and cross-subject predictions, and the results showed that cross-subject models always performed worse than within-subject models.\\n\\nIn data collection, the ground truth is usually determined on what the subject has to perform. Therefore it can be tricky as it is impossible to know what the subject is thinking or where the subject is precisely focusing on.\\n\\nBCI is particularly challenging because the theory is shared with multiple disciplines:\\n\\nneuroscience\\n\\nsignal processing\\n\\nmachine learning\\n\\ncomputational intelligence\\n\\ncognitive science\\n\\nphysics\\n\\nThese challenges show why rolling out BCI systems to the mass market is a monumental challenge.\\n\\nWhy Deep Learning for BCI applications\\n\\nIn recent years, deep learning has shown significant performance in various tasks; it has proven to outperform “traditional” machine learning approaches that use handcrafted features.\\n\\nDecoding the brain electrical activity with high variability and non-stationary noise into a meaningful signal is difficult. These difficulties lead to the use of machine learning algorithms to solve BCI applications.\\n\\nDeep learning has the ability to extract features and learn from hierarchical representations from high dimension data and has lead to many real-world applications in the area of computer vision and natural language processing. Given its effectiveness in other fields, deep learning seems promising to learn from raw EEG data to extract better features to improve performance and robustness.\\n\\nAn EEG data set is high dimensional, deep learning models with a high number of parameters might be able to learn the raw EGG signals directly.\\n\\nCommon deep learning architectures\\n\\nIn order to tackle the challenges in BCI application, researchers work on to improve extraction of essential features from EEG signals and to build models that can generalise better.\\n\\nRestricted Boltzmann machine\\n\\nA restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) learns the probability distribution of the input data based on a gradient ascent of the log-likelihood of the training data. Deep Belief Network (DBN) composed of three RBMs, where RBM can be stacked and trained in a deep learning manner.\\n\\nRecurrent neural network\\n\\nGiven that EEG data has a temporal structure, frequencies over time, the recurrent neural network (RNN) is suitable. RNN model sequential data via recursive, which is unfolding the RNN in time to form a feed-forward neural network to apply backpropagation.\\n\\nLong short term memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture that is composed of memory blocks which use gating units with a self-connected memory cell. LSTM solves the vanishing gradient problem that traditional RNNs suffer.\\n\\nConvolutional neural network\\n\\nRecent findings show the effectiveness of the convolutional neural network (CNN) for processing time series because they are able to learn the most relevant features from raw data. CNN can extend to higher dimensions to learn features required for the task. A convolutional layer is usually comprised of convolution, non-linear activation, and pooling.\\n\\nCNN has outperformed previous BCI competition winners on multiple tasks. However, an ensemble of SVMs obtained slightly better performance than the CNN approach. Several studies explored the idea of combining DBN with CNN and RNN with CNN. Combining DBN with CNN produce promising results.\\n\\nSchirrmeister et al. explored the effect of shallow and deep CNN models. They show that shallower (5 layers) fully convolutional models perform better than deep models.\\n\\nZhang et al. evaluated that depth ranging from 2 to 10 outperform deeper models in terms of accuracy, precision, F-measure and G-mean.\\n\\nDue to the small number of training samples available for BCI, many research works suggest those shallower architectures with much fewer parameters are proved to be more useful.\\n\\nRegularisation\\n\\nAs mentioned in the challenges of BCI applications, EEG signals are highly variable. EEG signals can differ significantly between subjects and even within the same subject, as the EEG contains interferences from ongoing brain activity and measurement noise.\\n\\nThese types of noise suggest the use of regularisation in order to keep the weights of the network small to reduce overfitting. The common regularisation methods for neural networks are L1 and L2, which add a penalty to the weights according to their magnitude and sign. Dropout technique is very commonly used as well.\\n\\nThese regularisation techniques generally improve the performance slightly and most research used at least one regularisation techniques.\\n\\nCurrent state-of-the-art models\\n\\nThe current performance of deep learning models is unclear whether it can outperform traditional processing techniques. This is because unlike natural image where there is the ImageNet dataset as a benchmark dataset, EEG does not have a benchmark dataset.\\n\\nIn BCI, many different tasks and different datasets were used in research, the results reported are highly bais to individual research for that particular dataset. Reporting performance metrics and methodology are varied between each study, lacking a standardised reporting methodology.\\n\\nReproducibility is crucial to moving a field forward; this has been seen in the computer vision community where technological advances very quickly. With the availability of open-source dataset and the sharing of codes, the computer vision community achieve state-of-the-art performance suitable for real-world applications.\\n\\nUnfortunately for BCI studies, many researchers use private dataset, and they do not release their codes publicly. Acquiring data is more expensive and annotated data requires subject matter experts contributions.\\n\\nProblems with deep learning in BCI applications\\n\\nAs training a deep learning model generally requires a large training dataset. Unlike the computer vision research community, where a vast amount of data is available; limited BCI data available pose a challenge to advance the field forward. High-quality data is also challenging to acquire, augmenting datasets or use of generative adversarial networks might be adopted.\\n\\nDeep learning models are great in memorising dataset, but given that EEG has low signals to noise ratio, models might memorise noise data. As a result, the performance is greatly affected even with various regularisation techniques.\\n\\nZhang et al. highlighted that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The consequence could range from merely user confusion and frustration, to significantly reducing the user’s quality of life, and even to hurting the user into danger on purpose.\\n\\nGenerally, deep learning models are regarded as black boxes where it does not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. This makes clinicians and end-users uncomfortable, especially when understanding how and why the model produces an output might be critical to make informed clinical choices. A study by Sturm et al. uses Layer-wise Relevance Propagation to transform decisions into heatmaps indicating each data point’s relevance for the outcome of the decision.\\n\\nDeep learning models can take a long time to train; thus, it would take a long time to calibrate on new users and before each usage. We cannot expect new users to spend hours recording their brain patterns on different tasks, and cannot allow BCI users to wait every time they want to use the system.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nResearchers need to develop more robust and consistent algorithms that can be easily trained and deployed. Algorithms must be able to work with small training samples, handle noisy signals, generalise well on users over different time as well as mood and generalise well over different users.\\n\\nMany studies are evaluated offline on a small number of subjects, but for actual BCI applications to work machine learning need to work in real-time.\\n\\nDeep learning advancement is lagging due to the lack of data and code sharing; progress can be much faster when researchers openly share dataset and codes.\\n\\nThere are many problems that need to be addressed before BCI applications can be rolled out to the mass market.',\n",

              "   'An Intuitive Explanation of Gradient Descent\\n\\nGradient Descent is widely used in the machine learning world and is essentially an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a cost function. In data science, gradient descent is used to refine the parameters (coefficients) of our model to minimize error. We’ll go through an example below to understand how gradient descent works.\\n\\nImagine that the graph above represents the relationship between people’s height and weight; taller people generally weigh more than shorter people. Suppose we wanted to find the line of best fit, that is the equation that best represents the data shown above.\\n\\nThe image above shows that the (red) line of best fit on the left is much more precise than the one on the right. This can be seen by looking at the distance between each point and the line of best fit. The less distance there is (the less error), the better the line of best fit. The line of best fit is represented by the equation that we’ve all learned in high school, y = mx + b.\\n\\nTo understand gradient descent, we first need to understand what the cost function is.\\n\\nA cost function is essentially something that we want to minimize; in this case, we want to minimize the distance between the data points and the line of best fit. You can think of the cost function as an error function if that makes more sense intuitively. To understand the cost function, let’s use an even simpler example.\\n\\nSuppose we have data points that fall right on the line of best fix, y = x, where the slope is equal to 1. In this case, the distance between the data points and the line of best fit, aka the cost function, would be equal to zero.\\n\\nNow imagine that we move the line of best fit to the green line so that the slope is equal to 2 (green line). Now, the distance between the data points and the line of best fit has increased. This means that the cost function has increased. Similarly, if we moved the line of best fit so that the slope was equal to ½ (blue line), the cost function would have equally increased as the green line.\\n\\nIf we plot the slope of the line of best fit with the corresponding cost function, we can see that a slope of one minimizes the cost function, aka minimizes the distance between the data points and the line of best fit. And if you look back at our graph with a slope equal to 1, this is true!\\n\\nNow onto the fun stuff.\\n\\nGradient Descent is an algorithm that is used to essentially minimize the cost function; in our example above, gradient descent would tell us that a slope of one would give us the most precise line of best fit.\\n\\nWhile it looks daunting, it’s rather simple. Let me explain:\\n\\nθj is equal to m (the slope)\\n\\nα is equal to the learning rate (I’ll explain this more later)\\n\\n(∂/ ∂θj)*J(θ) is equal to the partial derivative of the cost function at point m (slope of the cost function, not the line of best fit)\\n\\nRepeat until convergence simply means repeating the algorithm until it reaches a global optimum (minimum in this case).\\n\\nIn words, this algorithm means:\\n\\nRepeatedly subtract the slope of the line of best fit by the slope of the cost function at point m times a coefficient (α) until the slope of the partial derivative is zero.\\n\\nNew slope = old slope of line of best fit — alpha * partial derivative of the cost function at point m\\n\\nTo show an example, let’s say we start with a line of best fit that has a slope of 2. If we look at the point with a slope of 2 on the cost function (the green point), we can take the partial derivative of that point aka the slope of the green line that is tangent to the curve. Here, we can see that the partial derivative is positive. Looking back at our equation,\\n\\nNew slope = old slope of line of best fit — alpha * partial derivative of the cost function at point m\\n\\nThe new slope (m) would be equal to 2 minus a positive number (since the partial derivative is positive), which would bring us to the red point (shown above).\\n\\nIf the partial derivation was negative aka, if the point started on the left side of the graph, then the new slope would be equal to the old slope minus a negative number, which is equivalent to the old slope plus a positive number.\\n\\nWe would repeat this process until we reach convergence, aka we reach a minimum, and thus we would have determined the slope of the line of best fit that minimizes the cost function!\\n\\nJust a quick note on alpha (α) in the gradient descent algorithm,\\n\\nIf α is too big, then the algorithm will overshoot each iteration (as shown in the left graph), which may inhibit it from reaching the minimum. Conversely, if α is too small, it will take too long to reach the minimum. Thus, α must be in between the two so that neither of these cases occur.\\n\\nAnd that’s gradient descent in a nutshell!',\n",

              "   \"Can AI Algorithms be Biased?\\n\\nAI algorithms are increasingly being used in a wide range of areas for making decisions that impact our day to day life. Some examples are —Recruitment, Healthcare, Criminal Justice, Credit Risk Scoring etc. It's being used by not just private businesses but also governments.\\n\\nOne of the supposed benefits of using AI or machines in general for making decisions is — they may be impartial, objective and may not carry the same biases as humans do and hence may be more “fair”. Some of the recent studies have shown that AI systems can be biased as well.\\n\\nImagenet, the public Image database which feeds into various computer vision applications like Face Detection, recently removed 600K images when an art project exposed racial bias in its images. All this has lead to increased awareness about bias in AI and has raised basic questions related to trust against many AI systems.\\n\\nWhat is Bias?\\n\\nBefore we go deeper into this topic, its important to define bias. Here is a definition from Wikipedia\\n\\nBias is disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing, usually in a way that is closed-minded, prejudicial, or unfair.\\n\\nThere has been a lot of studies on the kind of biases humans suffer from, Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman talks about a variety of biases in human intuition in his excellent book Thinking Fast and Slow\\n\\nAn example of a bias from which humans commonly suffer from is — Confirmation bias. It is defined as a tendency to search, interpret and recall information in a way which confirms or strengthen one’s pre-existing beliefs. While one may think that the advent of internet and explosion of information (data) available to us would lead us to the “truth”, confirmation bias is what keeps people selectively interpret information and hinged to what they already believe.\\n\\nConfirmation Bias\\n\\nCase Studies of AI Bias\\n\\nA famous case study in AI Bias is the COMPAS system which is used by US courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. An investigation of the software found that, while the system was designed for maximizing overall accuracy, the false positive rates for African Americans was twice that of for Caucasians.\\n\\nAnother popular case study is — Amazon’s AI recruitment tool. Amazon had developed a tool to help with recruitment which helped in screening of resumes. It was trained on 10 years data of Amazon’s internal recruitment decisions. Amazon later decided to scrap the tool when it was discovered that the tool was more likely to pick men over women\\n\\nMathematical Definition of Bias\\n\\nWhile all that we have reviewed so far is good, but the definition of bias and fairness has a long history of debate in law, social science and philosophy. It's difficult to come to a consensus on exact definition of these. What makes it even more tricky in the context of AI models is we need to define it in mathematical terms as AI systems only understand numbers and mathematical operations.\\n\\nIt's important to distinguish biases from random errors. It's not uncommon for AI systems to make errors, this is because they are a simplification of the complex real world. But biases are systematic errors, which occur in a somewhat predictable way. Biases may cause one to act unfairly against an individual or a group.\\n\\nSome people have attempted to define the absence of bias in AI systems by balancing of false positive and false negative rates in predictions across groups example gender, race etc. But this definition is not generic enough due to various forms in which Bias may manifest itself. Frankly it's still an open research area.\\n\\nHow does Bias creep into AI systems?\\n\\nA natural question is how do AI systems get Biased? Can they be Biased even if they are not explicitly codified to be biased? Following is a list of some possible reasons why an AI system can get biased:\\n\\nChoice of Attributes: If one uses attributes like age, gender, ethnicity in algorithms, the algorithm can learn the relationship between these attributes and the target which may cause the algorithms to get biased.\\n\\nIf one uses attributes like age, gender, ethnicity in algorithms, the algorithm can learn the relationship between these attributes and the target which may cause the algorithms to get biased. Data Collection / Sampling: A lot of times, data may be collected or sampled in a way which leads to over or under-representation of a group which may lead to biases. There is a famous case study about Street Bump app by Boston municipal to detect potholes which suggested wealthier neighborhood had more bumps simply because people living in affluent neighborhood were more likely to use the app.\\n\\nA lot of times, data may be collected or sampled in a way which leads to over or under-representation of a group which may lead to biases. There is a famous case study about Street Bump app by Boston municipal to detect potholes which suggested wealthier neighborhood had more bumps simply because people living in affluent neighborhood were more likely to use the app. Implicit Bias in Data: Most of the AI systems learn patterns from the data which is provided to train them. A number of times the data may be generated by humans with their in-built biases. If this is the cases the resultant AI system would also reflect those biases as an AI system is only as good as the data fed to train them. Imagenet incident which I talked about earlier is a good example of this type.\\n\\nMost of the AI systems learn patterns from the data which is provided to train them.

Optimization Metric: AI systems typically train to maximize/minimize a certain metric, example error rate on the whole data. While the AI system is busy doing that, there is no guarantee that it would not do anything which we as humans would not deem “fair”.\\n\\nHow can we avoid AI bias?\\n\\nWhile it's still an open research area, here are some steps you could take to mitigate bias in your AI applications:\\n\\nUse Representative Data : Try to actively look for sources of bias in the data and/or the way it was collected and sampled. Look carefully into how the data was annotated and motivation & incentive of people annotating the data.\\n\\n: Try to actively look for sources of bias in the data and/or the way it was collected and sampled.

It's important to handle the bias issue so that AI systems continue to enjoy the trust of organizations and the masses.

Machines have learned to sense, respond, debate, discuss, and interact with reasoning to achieve such extraordinary capabilities which have been the territory of only expert human beings so far.\\n\\nThe preceding statements are reflective of the vast variety and broad spectrum of applications with varied maturity levels and much promise. There are a few points to note when we come across Machine learning and Big Data connecting them to Artificial intelligence.\\n\\n1. There is much to unlearn about information systems built when data, information storage, and access were at a premium.\\n\\nIt was necessary for engineers to follow computing models that required instructions for anticipating every possible scenario to develop information systems. Engineers were limited by programmable computing (a.k.a Von Neumann computing) to build systems that helped people both at work and in their personal lives. They still prevail for solving numerous business problems.\\n\\nIn the age of big data, the nature of computing is changing to fit the needs of more complex and uncertain scenarios. Computing has now begun to show the potential to adapt to humans naturally in every walk of life.\\n\\n2. Nature of decision making and problem-solving systems of the industrial age emphasized the left brain thinking based on logic and analysis for the most part.\\n\\nThe left brain thinking became the foundation of the automation mechanisms built to aid human and organizational endeavors. Left brain thinking and the infrastructure in the analytics space encompass applications built around traditional databases. These applications evolved and contribute to Business intelligence, broadly covering data warehousing, online analytical processing, and meta-data repositories. While all of them use past data and experience for knowledge and discovery — there are differences. The exercise is beyond the scope of this notes. The one thing in common is that they use sorting and searching algorithms with sequences of instructions which lead to responses from the systems.\\n\\n3. The potential of Big data and Machine learning is enabling to explore and build right brain systems which are taking shape as the AI ecosystem.\\n\\nSmart, intelligent, cognitive systems support the Artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem. Cognitive computing systems are developing human capabilities and interactions, and scale better than ever before. Machine learning, prescriptive and predictive analytics, deep learning, recommendation engines, evidence-based expertise, narrative science and much more comprise the Artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem backed by Cognitive computing.\\n\\nIn the consumer and business space, the technologies of analytics, big data, cloud, and AI are converging to form the AI ecosystem. The AI systems are capable of deriving inferences and pursue the objectives with the data provided. The AI systems draw on the fundamentals of statistics and data mining algorithms with iterative, improved learning from real time data.\\n\\n4. The AI ecosystem as heard in the business communities represents a higher maturity level of analytics compared to the descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics practices.\\n\\nExamining the types of questions asked and problems solved is a way to probe into the state of capabilities of the systems for the business. Tom Davenport brought up analytics maturity levels at the organization level more than a decade ago on how to take the first steps for exploring data based decision making in his work “Competing on Analytics.” He later discussed the three stages of Analytics maturity (Davenport, T. H. (2013)). He called the era of Business Intelligence as Analytics 1.0 (up to the mid-2000s with enterprise data warehousing capabilities and business intelligence software), Analytics 2.0 as the era of Big data (internet based social media and networks begin to amass data), Analytics 3.0 as the era of building analytical power into consumer products.\\n\\n5. Machine learning is different. The talk about machine learning is around predictive or descriptive learning using big data applying statistical and mathematical models that scale.\\n\\nData mining models and applications come closest — except they use large data bases. Typically, data mining tasks are grouping people or objects based on selected characteristics, estimating for inferring or guessing reasonably, predicting expecting behaviors as a consequence of previous actions. The list goes on with more statistical models with deeper selective techniques for evaluating relationships and associations.\\n\\nThe ability to question determines the level of understanding to find solutions. With descriptive analytics, there is an understanding of the power of analytics for starters. Progressing to predictive and prescriptive analytics lets the business come up with frameworks to arrive at desired results experimenting with product mixes. Machine learning overlaps with the foundations allowing to scale and iterative collaboration with man and machine. The use cases of predictive analytics are varied — for example, figuring consumer behavioral patterns, forecasting sales, predicting failures in machinery or fraud. [Ref: Chapter 6, Hurwitz, J., Kaufman, M., & Bowles, A. (2015)].\\n\\nMachine learning broadly encompasses supervised learning (through association, regression, classification) and unsupervised learning for pattern recognition — an engineering term for classifying. A super market chain or Amazon would prefer to know the customer’s next choice of items based on previous purchases. Customer too prefers to check out the cart faster. These recommendation engines and matching systems work with recognizing behavioral patterns obtained from the data. Recognizing patterns helps derive a response of likelihood of a behavior. Detecting frauds, stock market predictions with changing data and environment require learning and intelligence more than just depending on the system designed using a large database with traditional, structured queries. Applications for recognizing speech and faces, robotics, and biometrics use machine learning techniques. High-risk scenarios such as patient health management are yet another use case for advanced analytics combined with AI ecosystem.\\n\\n6. A broad spectrum of business analytics applications is beginning to show up as machine learning applications.\\n\\nAdvanced analytics including data warehousing applications scenarios are on one side of the spectrum. One such category of questions is those that predict re-order levels for inventory management based on sales next quarter. Machine learning is helping when answering questions such as alerting city security when a large-scale crime scene is unfolding in real time or even predict one. Applications based on machine learning and a mix of advanced analytics get better iteration after iteration — as they learn from the previous happenings. On the other end of the spectrum are the applications that mimic the brain with intelligence that far surpasses known human expertise in medical or space sciences. The infrastructure is built on the principles of Neuro Science and Nano Technology to design cognitive chips to take up part of the tasks the human brains can accomplish (see Dharmendra Modha and SYNAPSE).\\n\\n7. Watson, AlphaGo.\\n\\nAny briefing about AI systems is not complete without mentioning the AI Super computers IBM’s Watson and Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo. There are more in the race — most heard are Microsoft’s Oxford and Baidu’s Minwa. The problems that Watson takes up have come a long way since the initial Jeopardy win in 2011. Watson is being trained to aid doctors in the area of evidence based medicine for treating diseases better. AlphaGo is no longer limited to winning the Go board game. They are image recognition engines with natural language processing powers participating actively in the AI ecosystem.\\n\\nThe primary message is to focus on the ability to compute differently and use data uniquely to look beyond the horizons seeking the unexplored and understand subtleties. The structured and unstructured data from various sources is beginning to come out of the dark to shed light on the patterns, correlations to match data with deep expertise to answer tough questions for businesses. The broad and vast maturity levels of the analytics and big data capabilities is the guiding force for enabling AI ecosystem growth. To take the first step is to set the stage for a vision towards the organization’s power to tap into the potential of machine learning and big data. Cognitive systems with the power of big data and machine learning are to become the sources of new dynamic knowledge sources to think and act differently on information for businesses.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nAlpaydin, Ethem.

In our analysis, we focus on exploring travel patterns of New York City residents using 146+ million taxi trips taken for the year 2015. The complete code, visualizations & reports are available in the Github Repository\\n\\nPrior work:\\n\\nGPS based transportation networks have been studied in detail for traffic flow analysis and determining social dynamics [1]. Bike sharing datasets have been used for clustering locations based on the usage profile[2] and predicting bike demand[3]GPS based taxi datasets have been used to identify mobility patterns in Shanghai, China [4].\\n\\nIn[4], the trip distribution has been characterized as combination of 3 independent types and non-negative matrix factorization has been used to identify 3 patterns from 1.58 million trips in Shanghai, China. This is the core of our approach, as we are attempting to characterize taxi usage in New York City with a similar dataset. Prior analysis has also been done to produce transportation network graphs from street geometries[5]and subway maps[6].\\n\\nData Description:\\n\\na) Raw data : New York city taxi & Limousine Commission has made the taxi trips dataset available for public use since 2009 onwards[7]. We used this dataset to perform our analysis. The complete dataset contains ~150 million trips for each year & each row represents one trip, with features for starting and stopping point, distance travelled, taxi-charge, time taken etc. We are using 2015 dataset which contains 146,112,990 trips in total. For combining the geolocation data to census tracts, we used the extremely helpful NYC land-use dataset [8].\\n\\nb) Data transformation : We use the following variables for each trip :\\n\\nTrip starting timestamp\\n\\nStart point (Lat/Long)\\n\\nTrip stopping timestamp\\n\\nStop point(Lat/Long)\\n\\nCharges\\n\\nUsing these trips, we build our directed graph with start and stop location for a given trip as nodes. As an additional condition, we only used locations with high number trips (more than 500 in the year for a given pair of locations). From prior work we summarised that rounding off location coordinates to 2 decimal points is also an option and given our difficulties analysing the dataset with 40,000+ nodes, we are now in the process of reducing our network by 2 separate approaches:\\n\\nOne node for 5 manhattan blocks\\n\\nUsing 6 million most frequent trips to get 1275 most frequently travelled edges\\n\\nIn our current network, each node represents 200m x 200m around it and each edge represents the total number of trips between two nodes in a given year\\n\\nWe create features for month, day, weekday, period of the day etc from the timestamp. An issue that we faced during our initial analysis was that — due to geography of the network itself, we had a network where multiple nodes represented the same location with multiple entrances (e.g. Penn Station has multiple entries and exits & our network had multiple nodes representing the same real world location)\\n\\nSame location : multiple close nodes\\n\\nWe decided to merge our dataset with US Census Bureau census tracts which removed the above problem. We have 580+ nodes in the final network and are worked with analysing census tract as node and number of trips between two census tracts represented as an edge.',\n",

CyberCube’s analytics platform was incubated within Symantec, a global cybersecurity company and since 2018 has operated as a standalone venture-backed company. The startup’s technology allows insurance companies to decide which digital risks to avoid, mitigate or insure as Internet-connected technologies change the nature of risk. Cyber insurance is one of the fastest-growing insurance lines to emerge in decades and is expected to reach $20 billion in premium revenue by 2025.\\n\\nCyberCube’s customers include re-insurer Munich Re. The reinsurance industry is providing significant capital to nurture the growing cyber insurance marketplace. An extreme cyber event has the potential to deeply impact thousands of organizations at once and the accumulation of liabilities across multiple insured portfolios could result in substantial losses.\\n\\nCNA, one of the largest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurance companies, is also using CyberCube’s platform as is AON, a global professional services firm that is using the startup’s platform to deliver cyber (re)insurance solutions to its insurance carrier clients and prospects.\\n\\nInsurance carriers are increasingly looking for guidance on risk transfer, says CyberCube. Its cyber risk-modeling platform aims to enables its customers to guide their clients on accumulation risk management and exposure measurement.\\n\\n« There is a lot you can tell about a company from its website, the IP addresses it owns and operates, the amount of botniks or viruses detected and compromised credentials linked to it that can be found on the Dark Web. All of this information is extremely valuable to an insurance company that is trying to evaluate the risk, » CEO Pascal Millaire, said in an interview with The Innovator at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting of The New Champions in Dalian, China.\\n\\nAn enhanced grasp on potential exposures gives insurance carriers the confidence to price cover more accurately and offer more relevant products to their customers, he says.\\n\\nMillaire predicts that preparedness against cyber attacks will impact every line of insurance, including automobiles and homes. « We think the potential of cyber analytics will be transformational to the future of insurance, » he says.',\n",

This out-of-the-box skill doesn’t require much software savvy and more and more popular crypto currencies such as bit coin offer supreme anonymity to perpetrators.

The truth is that there is no such of a thing as being “fully secluded” from a cyber attack. As soon as an association realizes this, they have a better probability of staying clear of the “insurance guard gap” and are more equipped for new risks.\\n\\nIn numerous cases, organizations put jointly their cyber security services piece by part using various providers.

              "   'So for anyone who doesn’t know, I’m a bit of a Graylog fangirl. If my selfies were at all flattering I’d insert a pic of me sporting my Graylog t-shirt here. Although I leveraged Graylog at a previous job, I no longer use it day-to-day. For that reason, I went ahead and spun up an instance in my home lab to play with.\\n\\nI wanted to work on a project that hadn’t been done before while also filling in another gap in my life since switching from DFIR to Intel/Threat Hunt: Memory Forensics. That’s when I recalled a project I’d bookmarked months earlier: vol2log. This is a set of Python scripts that perform the prep and communication necessary for shipping Volatility JSON output files to Graylog.\\n\\nI started by setting up the inputs, grabbing a memory sample, and just playing with this project itself; seeing how everything looked coming into Graylog. It was very simple to use. Plus, not only does it ship the Volatility but it also checks for “potentially malicious processes” based on certain conditions being met. Essentially, it is looking for conditions with well-known processes that don’t align with common behavior, such as that described on the SANS memory forensics cheat sheet. For example, more than 1 process where only 1 should exist, incorrect parent processes, etc.\\n\\nNow that I knew the kind of data I was working with, I threw together a few pipeline rules to normalize the field names across the various plugins and to add a useful message field (since the default for vol2log was simply “True”). Here is an example of one of those plugin rules:\\n\\nrule \"volatility pslist normalize\"\\n\\nwhen\\n\\nto_string($message.plugin) == \"pslist\"\\n\\nthen\\n\\nrename_field(\"Hnds\", \"handle_count\");\\n\\nrename_field(\"Name\", \"process_name\");\\n\\nrename_field(\"PID\", \"pid\");\\n\\nrename_field(\"PPID\", \"ppid\");\\n\\nrename_field(\"Start\", \"process_start_time\");\\n\\nrename_field(\"Thds\", \"thread_count\");\\n\\nrename_field(\"TypicalServices\", \"typical_service_name\");\\n\\nrename_field(\"PotentiallyMaliciousProcess\", \"potentially_malicious\");\\n\\n\\n\\nset_field(\"process_name\",lowercase(to_string($message.process_name)));\\n\\n\\n\\nset_field(\"message\", concat(\"pslist plugin found process with name \", to_string($message.process_name)));\\n\\nend\\n\\nWith normalizations complete, I was able to create some visualizations. This was also the perfect opportunity to try Graylog 3’s “Enterprise Views” feature. Below are some shots of the view I created.\\n\\nThe next step for me was to improve the process a bit by throwing in some automation. With vol2log’s current set up, you’d have to run Volatility for each plugin and send to an output file and then run vol2log one-by-one for each plugin output. By adapting a bash script I had written a while back, I much improve this process by creating a method by which a user simply has to provide an output directory, the path to the memory image to analyze, the Graylog IP and port, and the name for the source. It then loops through the list of available plugins to run Volatility and then run vol2log. I’ve open sourced that script here: https://github.com/megan201296/vol2graylog.\\n\\nThe vol2log remote was also limited in the number of plugins is supported out of the box. I’m working on testing other plugins to see if they work with the existing vol2log “generic” processor and if so will add them to the default list script. For now, the list that will be run through is in the README of the repo.\\n\\nTo speed up the process of getting working with the data, I’ve also published a content pack that contains all the pipeline rules I made here: https://github.com/megan201296/graylog-content-packs. Since Views can’t be exported to content packs, I need to make a dashboard version in order to add it to the content pack, which I hope to do in the future.\\n\\nI am still actively working on this project but wanted to share what I have so far since it is functional and fairly useful already. I hope to write up an example use case soon to show how I might leverage this project to analyze memory images of potentially infected hosts.\\n\\nFeel free to submit issues or PRs to the repos.

Shortly afterwards, the scamsters send Whatsapp text with screen recording of the video call from the same unknown number.\\n\\nWhatsApp Screenshot\\n\\nIf someone has already blocked the number before receiving the Whatsapp text, the scamsters send the screen recording of the video call on Whatsapp via another unknown number. Then, they threaten the victims that they have contact numbers of their relatives & friends and they will send the screen recording of the victim’s video call with a nude girl to their relatives & friends. They also threaten that they will upload the screen recording on various platforms on the internet & make it viral. The scamsters use such threats and blackmail to extort money. They give their UPI IDs or bank details to extort money. It is also called “Cyber Sextortion”.\\n\\nWhatsApp Screenshot\\n\\nMany times, scamsters chat with victims in enticing language to trap them. When the victims get attached to the scamster & fall into their trap, the scamsters compel the victims for sex chat on video call.\\n\\nWhatsApp Screenshot\\n\\nSuch horrible attacks are rampant these days and whatsapp is an easy platform for such scamsters.

              "   'Several months ago I submitted what appeared to be a security flaw to CloudFalre’s bugbounty program. According to them, this is not a problem, it’s up to you to make up your own mind.\\n\\nCloudflare offers a system of JavaScript workers that can be used to execute code on the server side (at Cloudfalre therefore). This feature can be useful for static sites, maintenance pages etc … But it is also a great tool for pentest (serverless C&C, easy phishing proxy etc …). In this post we will explore Cloudflare bot protection bypass.\\n\\nIf you’ve ever tried accessing a site like shodan.io from Tor, you know how annoying these captchas are.\\n\\nFirst, we will register a domain (a free .tk domain will be sufficient) and create a Cloudfare account. Once the domain is validated by Cloudflare we need to add at least one valid DNS entry that uses proxy mode.\\n\\nOur DNS zone (you can use what ever IP you want)\\n\\nNow we are going to create a JavaScript worker that will fulfill the role of reverse proxy (full code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/jychp/cloudflare-bypass). Create a new worker and copy/paste worker.js content into it. You can customize TOKEN_HEADER, TOKEN_VALUE, HOST_HEADER and IP_HEADER values.\\n\\nThen add a route to you worker: proxy.domain.com/*\\n\\nOur route to the worker\\n\\nNow, if you try to reach proxy.domain.com, you will see “Welcome to NGINX.”. The JavaScript code is pretty easy to understand, it will look for a specific header (acting as a magic) and will forward your request to the given domain.\\n\\nTo easily use this proxy, a python wrapper is available in my GitHub repository, let’s play with it.\\n\\n\\n\\n>>> proxy = CFProxy(\\'proxy.domain.com\\', \\'A random User-Agent\\', \\'1.2.3.4\\')\\n\\n>>> req = proxy.get(\\'\\n\\n>>> print(req.status_code)\\n\\n200\\n\\n>>> print(req.text)\\n\\n108.162.229.50 >>> from cfproxy import CFProxy>>> proxy = CFProxy(\\'proxy.domain.com\\', \\'A random User-Agent\\', \\'1.2.3.4\\')>>> req = proxy.get(\\' https://icanhazip.com\\' >>> print(req.status_code)200>>> print(req.text)108.162.229.50\\n\\nYou can try to perform WHOIS request on the result, it’s a Cloudflare IP (probably the server running the worker).\\n\\nAt this point if you try to request your proxy through Tor, you will be blocked. We are therefore going to add a rule to our Cloudflare firewall (Firewall / Firewall Rules). There are several ways to get a rule to work, here is one:\\n\\nYou can use any other trigger\\n\\nNow you are able to request your proxy using tor without any annoying reCaptcha.\\n\\nAt this point you can request any site using Cloudflare (except if they are using “Under Attack Mode” (eg: shodan.io). But there is more with this script.\\n\\nTry to request a site who display your headers, and you will see:\\n\\nACCEPT: */*\\n\\nACCEPT-ENCODING: gzip\\n\\nCDN-LOOP: cloudflare; subreqs=1\\n\\nCF-CONNECTING-IP: 2a06:98c0:3600::103 (could be any Cloudflare IP)\\n\\nCF-EW-VIA: 15\\n\\nCF-RAY: [REDACTED]\\n\\nCF-REQUEST-ID: [REDACTED]\\n\\nCF-VISITOR: {\"scheme\":\"https\"}\\n\\nCF-WORKER: yourdomain.com (OPSEC Warning !)\\n\\nCONNECTION: Keep-Alive\\n\\nHOST: www.whatismybrowser.com\\n\\nUSER-AGENT: My Random User-Agent\\n\\nX-FORWARDED-FOR: 1.2.3.4 (yes, we can override this header with whatever we want !)\\n\\nX-FORWARDED-PROTO: https\\n\\nAs you can see, X-FORWARDED-FOR can be set to an arbitrary value, so you can bypass IP limitation requests during scrapping or more dangerous IP verification during a login procedure … The origin IP is not forwarded to the website, so the only way to block this kind of request on your server is to filter on CF-WORKER header.\\n\\nThis bypass is not a bug according to Cloudflare:\\n\\nIf it’s not a bug it’s a feature …\\n\\nSo let’s enjoy the 100 000 request/day for your free Cloudflare account and go scrape the world !',\n",

This exploit and discussion contained an unpatched zero day in all supported and Extended Security Update verrsions of Windows OS.\\n\\nUnfortunately by this had already been forked on Github by then… and the latest June 2021 security patches do not actually fix the issues. There appears to have been some kind of miscommunication or other error between Zhiniang and Microsoft.\\n\\n@edwardzpeng’s writeup tags the issues as CVE-2021–1675, which Microsoft themselves changed to Remote Code Execution on 21st June 2021.\\n\\nUnfortunately this patch does not solve the issue.\\n\\nBrief technical bit\\n\\nThe flaw is in RpcAddPrinterDriver, a legit function designed to allow remote printing scenarios and driver installation. The function is designed to allow users with SeLoadDriverPrivilege — by default Administrators and Print Operators — to add drivers to a remote Print Spooler. So, for example, your IT admins to install new printer drivers for users.\\n\\nPrint drivers are dangerous, as they’re full code execution, as SYSTEM.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it also has a logic flaw, where the remotely connecting party can specify parameters which invalidate authentication:\\n\\nOr in English, any authenticated user can remotely add any ‘print driver’ to Windows — you don’t need to be an administrator or have permission.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nWindows runs Print Spooler by default — including on Domain Controllers (by design) and Windows 7, 10 etc. It is also enabled on many Windows Server installations.\\n\\nYou can test it yourself by opening Task Manager, going to Services, then looking for the service name “Spooler”, which will be running.\\n\\nAny user you can connect to your endpoint’s Spooler service, with a valid account, can cause remote code execution.\\n\\nPatching\\n\\nSeveral days in, Microsoft have not commented on the problem, despite other vendors talking about it and providing detection. So you probably want to move on to mitigation and detection stages.\\n\\nMitigation\\n\\nSome people are recommending stopping the Print Spooler service organisation wide. I think that is an overreaction, and impractical for many organisations as printing is a core business process. Also, realistically many businesses have Windows Server 2003, won’t have finished June’s (or May’s.. or April’s) patching in reality — so it smells more of panic.

Kaseya’s website claims they have over 40,000 customers.\\n\\nFour hours ago, an apparent auto update in the product has delivered REvil ransomware.\\n\\nBy design, it has administrator rights down to client systems — which means that Managed Service Providers who are infected then infect their client’s systems.\\n\\nInfected systems look like this:\\n\\nHow this first unfolded\\n\\nInitial entry was using a zero day vulnerability in Kaseya VSA. This was CVE-2021–30116 (details have not been entered into CVE database, however it has been allocated for this). More CVEs may be issued.\\n\\nSo even if the latest version is used, at time of attack, attackers could remotely execute commands on the VSA appliance. Technical details of how to exploit the vulnerability are not being provided until the patch is available.\\n\\nIt is not a great sign that a ransomware gang has a zero day in product used widely by Managed Service Providers, and shows the continued escalation of ransomware gangs — which I’ve written about before.\\n\\nKaseya are preparing an software update to fix the vulnerability, which will be available in the coming days — until then, they advise all customers to leave their VSA switched off.\\n\\nDelivery of ransomware is via an automated, fake, software update using Kaseya VSA. The attacker immediately stops administrator access to the VSA, and then adds a task called “Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix”. This fake update is then deployed across the estate — including on MSP client customers’ systems — as it a fake management agent update. This management agent update is actually REvil ransomware. To be clear, this means organisations that are not Kaseya’s customers were still encrypted.\\n\\nThese files are dropped on client systems:\\n\\nPropagation\\n\\nBy design Kaseya is designed to allow administration of systems with high level privileges. So ransomware can push itself to systems.

We took swift actions to protect our customers: Immediately shut down our SaaS servers as a precautionary measure, even though we had not received any reports of compromise from any SaaS or hosted customers; Immediately notified our on-premises customers via email, in-product notices, and phone to shut down their VSA servers to prevent them from being compromised. We then followed our established incident response process to determine the scope of the incident and the extent that our customers were affected. We engaged our internal incident response team and leading industry experts in forensic investigations to help us determine the root cause of the issue; We notified law enforcement and government cybersecurity agencies, including the FBI and CISA. While our early indicators suggested that only a very small number of on-premises customers were affected, we took a conservative approach in shutting down the SaaS servers to ensure we protected our more than 36,000 customers to the best of our ability. We have received positive feedback from our customers on our rapid and proactive response. While our investigation is ongoing, to date we believe that: Our SaaS customers were never at-risk. We expect to restore service to those customers once we have confirmed that they are not at risk, which we expect will be within the next 24–48 hours; Only a very small percentage of our customers were affected — currently estimated at fewer than 40 worldwide. We believe that we have identified the source of the vulnerability and are preparing a patch to mitigate it for our on-premises customers that will be tested thoroughly. We will release that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running. I am proud to report that our team had a plan in place to jump into action and executed that plan perfectly today. We’ve heard from the vast majority of our customers that they experienced no issues at all, and I am grateful to our internal teams, outside experts, and industry partners who worked alongside us to quickly bring this to a successful outcome. Today’s actions are a testament to Kaseya’s unwavering commitment to put our customers first and provide the highest level of support for our products.

Add to it a crucial piece of information: said institute gets funding in cryptocurrencies (and the runner of the institute must escape the banking system as his royalties and speaking fees get confiscated by the U.S. government).\\n\\nClearly, it is a lunacy to compare Edward Snowden to Assange, Manning and, particularly, Ellsberg — and not just on account of that strange inversion of countries.

Snowden tried to lecture yours truly on public intellectualism while having exactly zero intellectual contribution; aside from his morals, Ellsberg is a solid intellectual with first rate contributions in decision-theory.\\n\\nNow the story. Yours truly has authored the bitcoin black paper in a peer-reviewed quantitative finance journal. It irritated the bitcoin community quite a bit and I have been subjected to quite a bit of trolling on social media.\\n\\nTrolling? No. Smear campaign, along with mob harassment. I mean real mob harassment — they manage to drive people off Twitter (as they did with the academic Simon De Deo who closed his account).\\n\\nThe Monsanto playbook used by Snowden: First they troll the person to death. Then they make sure to frame the trolled’s responses as bullying the “victims”, namely the trollers, or “narcissistic”, “cannot take criticism”, etc.\\n\\nBut remember that owing to my “BS busting” activities, I have had the fortune (or misfortune) to become an expert on smear campaigns and harassment thanks to 1) Monsanto (for my precautionary principle work), 2) The eugenists “race realists” alt-right (IQ work), 3) Covid and vaccine deniers (pandemics tail risk work), and now 4) Bitcoiners who strangely overlap with Covid Deniers. I also learned from my friend Ralph Nader (smeared by GM in the 1970s) who guided me through the steps.\\n\\nHow do you smear someone? Along with the nasty mob harassment, you make sure to demonize and prevent the person from being able to shout that he or she is being harassed [See fig.1]. Snowden called the harassers my “victims”, a category to which he subsequently identified himself, simply because I responded to him.\\n\\nHistorically, abusers trying to pass for victim receive extra punishment.\\n\\nThat episode of smear campaigning confirms that Snowden is neither bright nor distinctly innovative (now explain what do the Slavonicophones have to gain by having to carry a humorless and not particularly sharp guest who will stick around for the next few decades?) Snowden simply took my Twitter posts, showed my (colorful) responses, while hiding the identity of the people I was responding to. Elementary one-sided evidence, selective referencing, the cherry picking one gets in Charlatan-Training-101. Needless to say he did, in the process, some basement level virtue signaling and some bungled bigotteering. So, that total imbecile, Ed Snowden, didn’t realize that I came to Twitter to get corrected and collect free comments on my books and papers as evidenced below thanks to a Finnish engineer, Paavo Hietanen, who came first to bust Snowden.',\n",

              "   'There are so many reasons to dedicate more time, money, and resources to improving your cybersecurity.\\n\\nThis is true for your business, as well as for you as an individual. Did you know that well over 80% of all businesses globally were hit with phishing and cyberattack attempts 2019?\\n\\nAs cybercriminals and their equipment become more and more advanced, the chances of a costly security breach increase, too. Now definitely is not the time to be making mistakes or taking the importance of cybersecurity lightly.\\n\\nIn an effort to help keep you on the right track, here is a list of three common cybersecurity mistakes that you’re probably making, and how to rectify them.\\n\\nPoor passwords\\n\\nStrong passwords play a significant role in maximizing cybersecurity. If you are using weak passwords that can be easily guessed or cracked with the help of special software, you are at far greater risk of falling victim to an attack.\\n\\nYou might be surprised to learn what counts as a weak password. Basically, if it does not contain a decent mix of numbers, letters, and symbols, it probably isn’t as strong as it needs to be.\\n\\nRemember, it’s a fantastic idea to partner with a Cybersecurity specialist company, such as Triumph Technologies, if you need guidance when it comes to creating stronger passwords or identifying weaknesses in your cybersecurity approaches in general.\\n\\nNeglecting to update your software\\n\\nSoftware manufacturers are constantly keeping an eye on cybercriminals and watching for flaws in their programs.\\n\\nWhen a flaw or a weakness is identified, the manufacturers work tirelessly in order to create the necessary updates or patches to resolve the potential problems. Therefore, if you receive a notification of a new patch or update and you neglect to install it immediately, you are putting yourself and/or your business at risk.\\n\\nIf you have trouble juggling all of the updates for your various software and anti-virus programs, it’s a good idea to set the programs to update automatically.\\n\\nNot understanding the concept of phishing\\n\\nPhishing is one of the most common threats to cybersecurity-especially when you consider that the majority of security breaches happen as a result of human error.\\n\\nWith that in mind, it is vital that you ensure that you and your employees all understand how phishing works and how to spot a phishing email. Essentially, it revolves around somehow convincing a person to provide their personal or financial details willingly.\\n\\nYou can avoid falling victim by bearing in mind that no legitimate companies would request any of your personal details via email, and always being vigilant about what information you disclose.\\n\\nAlso, keep an eye out for spelling or grammatical errors, as these are usually red flags. Finally, never download an attachment or click on a link from an email address that you do not recognize.\\n\\nAll in all, optimizing your cybersecurity means being more alert and accepting that everyone-including yourself and your business-is a potential target.',\n",

They identify security threats and protect their company assets from digital assaults.\\n\\nOur Cyber Security professionals share some projects that they have worked on:\\n\\nParul Khedwal — Cyber Security Consultant shares that she has worked with a reputed e-commerce company where she dealt with Data security and data breaches. According to her Cybersecurity is about dealing with various kinds of data breaches and cyber attacks on a day-to-day basis. Her role was to protect the company’s data by performing data analysis, researching cyber signs and anonymous patterns. She worked for an e-commerce platform where her responsibility was to deal with data security, email security.\\n\\nHighs of Cybersecurity:\\n\\nShe also shares that there are a lot of highs involved in the Cybersecurity role, the first reason being it is very dynamic and challenging. The subject is evolving every day which demands constant learning. The best aspect is it keeps you motivated due to the good learning opportunities involved in it. This role will never go out of the market because it’s a niche skill. Cybersecurity roles have good career scope in the market.\\n\\nLows of Cyber Security:\\n\\nCybersecurity being very dynamic and we know that hackers can attack anytime and any day. One needs to be on their toes protecting the data as an attack may happen anytime. The cyber consultant needs to be very flexible working in odd shifts which impact the health (both physical and emotional) in the longer run.\\n\\nWho does a Cyber Security consultant work with?\\n\\nParul is leading the Security operations team which involves working closely with her team members helping them with investigations, the client’s as per their requirements, the SIM team, and various other team members which make this role a very diverse role to deal with.\\n\\nTo summarise, a Cyber Security Consultant plays a variety of roles within the Cyber Security realm. They also get to work on diverse projects.\\n\\nThese consultants strive to protect the security system, network, and software and strengthen the security system to prevent hackers.

              "   'With each new advancement in the world of technology, there also comes a new advancement in the world of fraud. From the very first email scams in the earliest days of the internet to the latest advancements in fraudulent tech schemes, it seems fair to assume that things are always going to be this way. That doesn’t mean that you have to fall victim to online fraud, though. There are always ways to avoid the latest trickery, and this includes one of the latest methods: SMS spoofing.\\n\\nThankfully, there are ways to define SMS spoofing — no matter what type of SMS spoofing is being used — and practical solutions to pursue if you feel you may have fallen victim to fraudulent SMS spoofing.\\n\\nDefining SMS Spoofing\\n\\nIf you’ve had a cell phone for a while now, you probably remember when text messaging went by a different name: SMS. It’s an abbreviation that stands for Short Messaging Service, and it really is just another way to say “texting.” SMS spoofing is the act of altering or flat out replacing the sender’s number so that the text appears to be coming from someone else when it arrives at the receiver’s phone. A spoof SMS can arrive in a person’s phone under a different name, a different number or both — effectively allowing the sender to put out an untraceable message that can’t be replied to or blocked.\\n\\nOf course, this tool can be used for good and bad.\\n\\nGood Versus Bad SMS Spoofing\\n\\nIn the same way that email is not inherently bad simply because emails can be used for nefarious purposes, SMS spoofing is not an entirely bad thing just because people use it for bad purposes. Many brands and businesses use spoofing as an extension of their brand’s voice, and it’s been a very useful tool for them to communicate with consumers. By sending SMS spoofs out to a long list of marketing subscribers, companies can disguise the number the promotional material is being sent from while still getting the word out and restricting unwanted replies.\\n\\nWhile it has useful purposes, it’s worth discussing all the ways SMS spoofing can be used for fraud.\\n\\nTypes of SMS Spoofing Fraud\\n\\nAs you might imagine, there are all kinds of different ways that fraudsters can use SMS spoofing for bad instead of good. For example:\\n\\nSending a phishing scam under the guise of a reputable company\\n\\nRequesting money while disguised as a friend or family member\\n\\nPosing as a financial institution in order to obtain personal information\\n\\nAttacking someone’s character under a fake name and number to assume anonymity\\n\\nEach one of these examples of SMS spoofing fraud has been used far and wide in recent years, and it’s created quite the legal grey area for the authorities trying to put a stop to things. Because the sender’s name and number are hidden and replaced with a fake name and number of the sender’s choice, it can be a real headache trying to trace those SMS spoofs to their original source. Simply put, SMS fraud is a completely different ballgame compared to other forms of text fraud.\\n\\nWhat Distinguishes Spoofing Fraud From Other Forms of Text Fraud?\\n\\nWhile it might sound like SMS spoofing is more or less the same as other forms of text and email fraud, there is one big distinction: SMS spoofing is harder to identify. With email fraud and text fraud, it’s not too difficult to go into the sender’s contact info and see that the name, the number, or the address do not look legitimate at all. SMS spoofing is coming from a name and number that looks identical to the real thing, and it makes it quite difficult to identify if it’s not suspected or expected. This is the main thing that sets SMS spoofing apart from other forms of text fraud: the disguised name and number of the sender.\\n\\nWhat to Do When You Suspect Fraudulent SMS Spoofing\\n\\nIf you suspect you may be a victim of SMS spoofing, don’t fret: there are steps to be taken and tips to remember.\\n\\nDon’t click on unfamiliar links. An important thing to keep in mind is to avoid clicking links sent over texts from people who don’t typically send you links. These days, no matter if you’re communicating over iMessage or Facebook Messenger or some other SMS service entirely, there are typically link previews that show you whether a link is legit or not. If you get a link from someone who doesn’t normally send you links and there’s no link preview, you should absolutely not click it unless you’ve verified it’s legit. This could involve a phone call to the sender or even an in-person discussion. Don’t believe an offer that’s too good to be true. Oftentimes, SMS spoofs will attempt to get your guard down by sending you an offer that seems too good not to click on. Use your discretion: If this SMS spoof comes from a place you don’t normally shop at and don’t recall signing up for offers from, odds are it’s fraudulent. Likewise, if it comes from a place you do shop at and doesn’t seem like the kind of offer you’d expect from them, you can also probably assume it’s not legit. Don’t believe requests to reset your password. Another popular attempt to get people to click links is by asking them to reset their password by clicking the link. Almost 100 percent of the time, these password resets have to be requested by you and will come to your email. They’ll never come spontaneously to you over text. Asking for personal info? Don’t believe it. A bank, a financial institution, a law enforcement official, a debt collector, a service provider — none of these places will ever request your phone number, your personal data, or your financial info over text. If you get a text that seems to be from one of these institutions and it’s asking for your personal info, ignore it. It’s not real.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line: Contact the Experts at Simplitfy for Help with IT\\n\\nIf you suspect SMS spoofing and would like to increase the security of your devices, get in touch with us at Simplitfy for expert guidance. As an IT provider with a wide range of services for both personal use and business use, Simplitfy is ready and able to protect you and your tech from fraudsters of any shape or size.

              "   'Amazon declined to testify at congressional hearing on SolarWinds hack\\n\\nFor all the articles in this series on the SolarWinds Hack, see the list of links at the bottom of this article.\\n\\nI used to write for a security blog as Director of Security Research for a security vendor. I wrote a contrarian article at the time about how some companies may be more secure in the cloud — if they use the platform correctly. I also wrote a white paper based on my experiences on the Capital One cloud engineering and later security operations team about the need to balance security and innovation.\\n\\nAs soon as the first S3 bucket breach hit the news, the public relations team at the company came running to me and wanted me to write about how the cloud is not secure. They wanted to pin the blame on Amazon and write scandalous headlines about the company’s cloud platform. I still get questions during presentations from people who think AWS should handle all their security for them and try to shift responsibility to elsewhere when they misconfigure their systems hosted on a cloud platform and fail to follow cybersecurity best practices.\\n\\nThis misunderstanding of cloud platforms, secure configurations, contractual obligations, and cybersecurity in general lead to a lot of misinformed and alarmist headlines by news organizations. Instead of trying to truly understand the technology and the root problems that caused the SolarWinds hack, news organizations are now writing articles with headlines that imply Amazon is somehow an accessory to the criminal activity in the SolarWinds hack.\\n\\nRead my prior blog post if you want to understand how AWS and Azure platforms were leveraged by attackers in the SolarWinds breach. I wrote a more detailed technical explanation a few days after the breach was announced in December of last year. You can find the link at the bottom of this article.\\n\\nIf Amazon had anything to do with this attack via the SolarWinds malware they would be completely inept. I don’t have the evidence to review, so I’m just explaining why it makes no sense. The trail the malware takes leads squarely and obviously back to AWS. The fact the DNS names resolve to Amazon hosts is so blatant that a junior cybersecurity engineer or IT person would be able to figure this out. Anyone who knows anything about cybersecurity knows an attacker who wanted to avoid attribution would not use servers in their own data center.\\n\\nIf Amazon wanted to attack these systems for some reason they would get systems hosted in Russia or China to try to deflect attribution to a third party. They would not undermine their entire business model by hosting servers that support malware or malicious actors on their platform. Some other cloud providers have potentially malicious traffic coming from their networks, but to my knowledge and based on inspection of network traffic Amazon is not blatantly allowing criminals to reside on their cloud platform. If someone has evidence to the contrary that would stand up in a court of law, let me know.\\n\\nMore likely in this case, someone is trying to leverage US cloud platforms because so many organizations in the US are throwing network security out the window and allowing all traffic to and from these platforms in favor of identity alone as a security mechanism. This is a mistake as I explain in a prior post on Zero Trust for Software Updates: Consider network requirements before purchasing software products and my book on Cybersecurity for Executives in the Age of Cloud. Organizations that block international IP addresses belonging to potential foreign adversaries leave their networks wide open to AWS, Azure, and other US networks.\\n\\nBut why did Amazon decline to attend the congressional hearing? I’m not privy to Amazon’s legal decision-making processes. They have already provided information to the government about this matter as explained in this article by the Wall Street Journal. Perhaps they were concerned about inflammatory and misconstrued headlines and articles based on their statements in a public hearing made by people who don’t fully understand cybersecurity or cloud platforms. Showing up to the hearing to “testify” sounds like Amazon is on trial, when in fact they are not the perpetrator of this crime according to any information known publicly at this time.\\n\\nThere are some in congress who may be angered by the fact that Amazon shut down Parler, a right-wing social media platform after users called for politicians and police to be killed. Perhaps those same people would like to attack Amazon in the public eye and the company is avoiding this politically-motivated confrontation. However, the irony is that just like Amazon shut down Parler, they would have shut down this malware for violating terms of service had they been notified of its presence.\\n\\nI don’t know exactly when AWS was notified that this malware was running on their platform, but Microsoft took down the infrastructure in its cloud, Azure, which effectively prevented the malware from reaching the AWS servers. At that point, the infrastructure in AWS was a non-issue. Microsoft testified in front of congress and “took a grilling” according to this Reuter’s news article. Perhaps Amazon did not want that same grilling because, as I explained in my last article, the SolarWinds hackers were customers of AWS and Azure. Those customers should be on trial, not the cloud providers.\\n\\nI despise speculation in news articles. I tell my students in my cybersecurity class that any time a scandalous news article comes out, wait two days for the truth. I know one reporter who is still digging for the truth. The WSJ article also highlights the fact that Amazon has, in fact, already provided information to the proper authorities regarding this crime though the headline is a bit questionable. Sometimes information related to crimes is not publicly disclosed during an investigation for a reason. Check multiple sources for information before jumping to conclusions. Be cautious with click-bait headlines and wait for some real news.\\n\\nTeri Radichel — Follow me @teriradichel\\n\\n© 2nd Sight Lab 2021\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\nHave a Cybersecurity or Cloud Security Question?

              "   'How to Safeguard Your Digital Life\\n\\nPhoto by Sigmund on Unsplash\\n\\nLike it or not, devices rule our lives. From pictures to bank accounts to financial statements, every part of our lives is documented in some way on our phones, laptops, or desktops. But how secure are those precious memories, assets or important documents? And how are we keeping track of them?\\n\\nA few weeks back, headlines were abuzz over a programmer who couldn’t recall the password to his secure hard drive which held over $200 million in bitcoin. Another individual has been requesting to search a garbage dump to recover a hard drive with 7,500 bitcoins that he believes he threw in the trash in 2013. Reports estimate over $140 billion in bitcoin have been lost after individuals forgot their passwords.\\n\\nI thought of all I possess on my phone or laptop. Where am I storing my passwords? Are there any records of them? What happens if I lose my phone? How would my loved ones even know how to access if needed?\\n\\nIn the past several years, our lives have become increasingly digital, from our bank accounts, PayPal, Venmo, emails, pictures and social media accounts. So how can you keep a record of your passwords and keep it secure? How can you best pass that information on to your loved ones in the event of your untimely demise? Several experts weighed in on this timely topic.\\n\\nKeep a Record\\n\\nThe first thing to do in keeping your digital wallet safe is to keep an inventory of your devices and a record of all your identifications and passwords. With so many passwords to maintain track of these days, this may seem time-consuming at first. Maintaining a list of all written phrases or passwords and keeping them in a secure place — such as a safe — is a good start.\\n\\nAnd while it seems reasonable to start this list on a spreadsheet or a document, a hard copy is essential. After all, if the list is only kept on your computer, who would know it is there? Keep it in a safe place, and let someone else know it exists.\\n\\nPassword Protect All Accounts\\n\\nDo you have a password on all your devices? William Cannon from Signaturely, an online platform that allows digital signatures for documents, noted the importance of single or double-factor security. It only takes a few moments of your time to set up and use identifications for all of your devices. You may be exchanging thousands of dollars for a few minutes by not guarding your devices and information. When inspected in monetary terms, the difficulty of regularly typing a password may be worth it.\\n\\nUpdate All Devices\\n\\nWhile this seems like a given, how many times do you forget to update your devices? If you use your device to make financial transactions this is even more critical.\\n\\nEnsure that the electronic devices you use for financial transactions are up to date with the latest security software and install security updates as soon as they become available.\\n\\nMake a List\\n\\nKeeping a physical list of all your accounts and passwords can be a bit time-consuming. However, saving our passwords on our devices only works if you have the device. What if you lose your phone? Or drop your laptop?\\n\\nWhile a list can be done on your computer, it is crucial not to email it to yourself or label it as “passwords.” Should your email get hacked or your device fall into the wrong hands, all your valuable information could be in the possession of another party. Keep your physical list in a safe place, and let a loved one know about it as well. According to Lauren Patrick from Curricula, a cybersecurity awareness training company, if your email was ever breached, the document could fall into the hands of someone who should not have access to all of your passwords and identification.\\n\\nThink Before You Click\\n\\nDo you automatically open your emails? Click on links? Phishing and spear-phishing emails pose a great threat to your security so never click on any link in an email or text message unless you have absolutely confirmed that the communication with the link is legitimate.\\n\\nDon’t Use a Public Network\\n\\nUsing a public internet connection can easily compromise your IP address and initiate an access point for a hacker. Using a VPN is the easiest way to create a secure line between you and a server, thereby hiding your IP address, said Heinrich Long, Privacy Expert at Restore Privacy.\\n\\nPassword Safety\\n\\nMany people reuse their passwords over and over. They also may use birthdays, addresses, names, or other variations that can be easy for thieves to figure out. The best passwords use a combination of letters, characters, and numbers and are never reused for other accounts.\\n\\nIn addition, Jake Hill, CEO of DebtHammer, a top personal finance publication, suggested not to reuse passwords. Invest in a password vault and let it handle all of your passwords. Be vigilant in checking your account activity, and make sure you have text alerts set up just in case someone else logs into your account.\\n\\nCold Wallets\\n\\nWhat about crypto holdings, such as bitcoin? While you receive support from a bank if your credit card is stolen, if your digital coin holdings are compromised, there are very few options for recovery.\\n\\nFor these types of investments, a cold wallet may be a safer bet, said Steven J.J. Weisman, lawyer, a college professor who teaches White Collar Crime at Bentley University and one of the country’s leading experts in scams, identity theft, and cybersecurity. A cold wallet, such as a USB or a hard drive, is not connected to the Internet and is therefore less susceptible to being hacked.\\n\\nTake Extra Precautions\\n\\nWhat are some other precautions you can take to protect yourself? Some of the best ways may also be the simplest. Don’t leave your cell phone unattended. If you are in public, make sure no one is standing over you. For iPhones, make sure “Find My iPhone” is turned on.\\n\\nTake the extra time and protect yourself today!',\n",

The session will be approximately one hour long, depending on your availability.\\n\\nDuring the session, you’ll be asked about cyber security at your local authority, and you may be asked to review any early ideas or prototypes the project has been developing. Don’t worry if you don’t know much about cyber security! We don’t want to test your knowledge, we just want to understand how to build a framework that’s useful for everyone. Find out more and apply to take part in user research.\\n\\nCyber Support\\n\\nThe Cyber Support remediation work launched in November 2020, and we’ve been working with selected councils to reduce their cyber risk through guidance, tools and technical support. You can read more about what the project has achieved so far in our recent sprint notes.\\n\\nDuring their last sprint (3–16 February), the team completed all workshops with councils, with reports written and funding applications submitted.\\n\\nThis means that to date we have:\\n\\nconducted 27 out of 27 planned cyber workshops\\n\\nwritten and agreed 25 out of 27 reports\\n\\nsubmitted 22 out of 27 council applications for cyber funding\\n\\nstarted to schedule support sessions with councils for remediation activity\\n\\nWe will be holding fortnightly virtual show and tells for national and local government.\\n\\nJoin the Cyber show and tells\\n\\nIf you work in a national or local government agency and would like to find out more about our work, come along to our upcoming show and tells:\\n\\nFriday 12 March, 11:30am–12:00pm — an update from the Cyber Health project\\n\\nFriday 26 March, 11:30am–12:15pm — updates from both projects\\n\\nFriday 9 April, 11:30am–12:00pm — an update from the Cyber Health project\\n\\nFriday 23 April, 11:30am–12:15pm — updates from both projects\\n\\nClick here to request joining details.

Cyber attacks & its threat are increasing problems for businesses.\\n\\nWe often hear about businesses paying huge fines and even winding up their businesses due to systems being hacked.\\n\\nThere are numerous threats to ignore risks from ransomware to phishing that could cost you your livelihood.\\n\\nPrevention is the solution.\\n\\nThis blog will explain ways to protect your business successfully.\\n\\nWhat is a Cyber Attack?\\n\\nA cyber attack is conscious exploitation of your systems and network. Cyber attacks utilize malicious code to compromise your PC, logic or data and steal and hold your data hostage. Cyberattack is vital for each business and organization.\\n\\nHere are a few categories of common cyber-attacks and kind of data breach:\\n\\nIdentity theft, fraud, extortion\\n\\nMalware, phishing, spamming, spoofing, spyware, trojans and viruses\\n\\nStolen hardware, for example, PCs or cell phones\\n\\nBreach of access\\n\\nPassword sniffing\\n\\nSystem infiltration\\n\\nPrivate and public Web program misuses\\n\\nInstant messaging abuse\\n\\nProtected innovation (IP) burglary or unapproved access\\n\\nWays to protect your systems from cyber attacks:\\n\\nTrain your staff\\n\\nQuite possibly the most well-known ways cyber crimes gain access to your information is through your employees. They’ll send deceitful messages impersonating somebody in your office or company and will either request personal details or for access to certain documents. This is the reason employee mindfulness is crucial. Perhaps the most effective approaches to ensure against cyber attacks and a wide range of data breach is to prepare your staff on cyber attack prevention and educate them regarding current cyber attacks. Keep your systems up to date\\n\\nCyber attacks happen because your frameworks or software aren’t completely up to date, leaving shortcomings. Hackers misuse these shortcomings to access your organization. To neutralize this current, it’s savvy to put resources into patch management that will deal with all product and system refreshes, keeping your system strong and modern. Guarantee Endpoint Protection\\n\\nEndpoint insurance ensures networks that are remotely bridged to gadgets. Cell phones, tablets, and PCs that are associated with corporate organizations give access to security risks. These ways need protection with explicit endpoint security software. Firewall installation\\n\\nPutting your organization behind a firewall is quite possibly the best approach to protect yourself from any cyber attack. Data backup\\n\\nIn case of a calamity (frequently a cyberattack), you should have your data backed up to keep away from loss of data and real financial crunch. Employees personal credentials\\n\\nEach worker needs their login for each application and program. A few clients interfacing under the common Credentials can put your business at risk. Having separate logins for each staff member will assist you with minimizing attack fronts.\\n\\nStrategies and tips mentioned above are extremely helpful in securing a business network and software and preventing security threats.

You first buy a pigeon, train it properly to recognize the address of your frequent mail list and then you’ll tie the message to its legs.\\n\\nNow if you’re wondering what all this is about, you might wanna check the privacy agreements of all the apps you used. The recent case of Pegasus systems puts this case in perspective. Data is not safe anymore. No matter what encryption you use UTF-18, a double Captain Kirk cipher or even Klingon to keep your message safe, it is undeniable that most of your data is under risk.\\n\\nPegasus is spyware which can be used to gather information from a user Now if you don’t know what spyware means, it is just a piece of software that can be used to snoop on you, gather the information that they need without the knowledge of the actual user or administrator of the system.\\n\\nTo start with the story, WhatsApp uses something called end-to-end user encryption. Now, if you’re familiar with the fundamentals of cybersecurity, the first question that pops up in your mind is “what the hell is that?” It is just a dandy name for a hybrid version of single key encryption and double key encryption.\\n\\nIt is not very easy to break into this system and gather all the *air quotes* private messages that you send through WhatsApp but it is not impossible.\\n\\nIf your question is how these spyware tries to break something as secure as WhatsApp, the answer might be you.\\n\\nDo you remember all those EULAs(End-user license agreements) that you signed? Yeah didn’t think so. Studies show that the average time that a user spends on the EULA pages is around 6 seconds. Now, apart from the people who are genuinely concerned about their safety, we usually take a second or so to scroll down to the bottom that is if the case demands you scroll down all the way to proceed to the next step. By doing this, you’re giving away the key to protecting your data.\\n\\nNot just Pegasus, there are a lot of services out there that can break your privacy in a matter of seconds. We must remember that no software is perfect without its deal of flaws (well except for Reddit maybe) and if you are not careful, you might even reveal your SSN, Credit card numbers, etc.\\n\\nWhat can we do to protect or data?\\n\\nI am glad you asked. Follow these simple steps and no one will be able to crack your files in no time (they still might be able to… well not everyone is HackerGiraffe though)\\n\\nRead those EULA pages at least once before signing them\\n\\nDon’t use untrustable pirates\\n\\nUse Eprivo to protect your emails (No they’re not sponsoring me)\\n\\nTry not to connect to public networks, even if you must use a VPN.\\n\\nLast but not least……..

              "   'Neural-biometrics access management system: the new age of one notable technology\\n\\nIf you have ever thought about using biometrics as an additional security factor, you have probably heard skeptics’ opinions. Actually, they are not that untruthful.\\n\\nTraditional biometrics access management systems have several vulnerabilities like imperfect liveness detection or the necessity to store sensitive data.\\n\\nBut there is SVORT which is a big difference from what we mean by biometrics.\\n\\nIts feature is a particular neural network algorithm combined with biometrics and infallible liveness detection.\\n\\nThis great combo enabled the establishment of a perfect neural-biometrics access management system which is entirely invulnerable to spoofing attacks and data breaches. The following explains how SVORT works and what the key features make it outstanding.\\n\\nHow does neural-biometrics work?\\n\\nThe process of neural-biometrics authentication operates as follows. The particular neural network algorithm learns to detect users by their faces. A camera scan a person’s appearance at different angles. Then the system transforms the user’s face into code which itself is the private and depersonalized key.\\n\\nSuch a key is depersonalized because it does not contain any sensitive data. That is, even it is stolen it won’t enable attackers to get access to your data because the transformation of biometrics data into code is irreversible.\\n\\nThat is what makes SVORT invulnerable to data breaches.\\n\\nLiveness detection as the main anti-spoofing tool\\n\\nPhoto, video, and mask spoofing are presented as the fundamental argument against biometrics access management systems. But a strong anti-spoofing tool already exists. It is liveness detection.\\n\\nIn terms of biometrics, liveness detection is the computer’s ability to determine whether it interacts with a human being. Camera understands whether it is a live person which physically present in front of it. Neither photo nor video and mask can override the system:\\n\\nThe depth tracking sensor determines the volume making photo and video spoofing impossible.\\n\\nThe infrared sensor prevents mask spoofing as it tracks the face heat map.\\n\\nOrdinary web cameras can also be used for liveness detection, 3D-face map building, and emotional challenges, i.e. there is no need to buy special equipment.\\n\\nCombining neural networks, liveness detection and biometrics we get troublefree access management mean that prevents all kinds of spoofing and protects data reliably.\\n\\nWhere biometrics access management system with liveness detection can be used?\\n\\nThe biometrics technology has been gaining around the recent few years due to its convenience along with the high-security level. Using neural networks brings it to security perfection so it can be successfully applied to improve both personal and enterprise security.\\n\\nImproving private security\\n\\nInternet users can apply the SVORT authenticator as one of the security factors within multifactor authentication. Use such a system along with a strong password created by a password manager. You can be sure your data is reliably protected. The risk of a sensitive data breach is almost non-existent.\\n\\nIt is possible due to using your face as a key. Neither beard nor makeup, scars, or new hair dress impacts the users’ recognition process as the network algorithm memorizes not a face but its 3D models.\\n\\nRaising enterprise security\\n\\nNeural-biometrics access management systems can also be applied in businesses and government structures. It can protect sensitive business data if integrated into the company’s hardware environment. Such systems can also provide enterprises with safe access to offices, industrial buildings, and separate premises.\\n\\nKeeping corporate data safe\\n\\nEmployees can use neural-biometrics access management systems within multifactor authentication to get access to a certain program, service, resource or computer itself.\\n\\nWebcam scans an employee’s face to provide him with access. Then it maintains periodic inspections to authenticate the user. For this purpose, the system can use:\\n\\nrotational challenges (turn your head to the left, etc.);\\n\\nemotional challenges (raise your eyebrows, smile, etc.);\\n\\nhidden background inspections.\\n\\nIf an employee leaves workstation SVORT will automatically block his computer and it will be obligatory to pass authentication to unlock it.\\n\\nSVORT can also replace existing authentication systems in offices providing employees with passwordless access. It will ease the overburdened technical support departments and save lots of time for employees as they will not have to use passwords and restore lost ones.\\n\\nIndustrial buildings security\\n\\nNeural-biometrics access management systems can be integrated into existing security systems to provide employees and clients with keyless access to buildings. Right after the integration, the system starts memorizing people who continue using keys or personal cards for passing in.\\n\\nIn a few days biometrics keys are created and the next time the system will unlock the door even before the person reach the physical key. The same principle is also available for use in separate premises. It is also possible to restrict entering a premise or allow it to certain people.',\n",

Last Thursday, during the maintenance of an interactive display in Kalmar, Sweden, an unknown user infiltrated the systems that control the screen to display images of a pornographic site.\\n\\nAccording to international media, Karl-Johan Bodell, regional director of public transportation company KLT, mentioned that a bus operator reported the incident to his bosses. In turn, the company notified the local authorities.\\n\\nThe display, located at Kalmar Central Station in southeastern Sweden, was soon deactivated by the local government’s information security team, who announced that the device will remain off until the authorities conclude the investigation incident.\\n\\nAlthough an official stance on the incident has not yet been revealed, local media immediately began raising the possibility of a cyberattack, although this still needs to be confirmed by the company or local investigative agencies.

A couple of weeks ago, an electronic traffic signal was hacked in Kentucky, US, to show drivers inappropriate messages.

              "   'With all the connectivity that the internet has to offer, it is critical to remember to apply caution in everything you do online. There are a variety of ways in which malware can infect your computer system; Thomas Leen, an Information Security Professional, has an overview regarding how to identify 5 different kinds of malware, as well as what measures of protection are needed against them.\\n\\n1. Virus\\n\\nThe word ‘virus’ is used as a blanket term by the media for all types of malware; an actual virus can physically alter files on your computer. After such modifications, programs on your computer will be configured to run malicious software, and these changes are difficult to reverse.\\n\\nThe best virus protection is still antivirus software, as it can routinely scan your computer, immediately informing you of any suspicious files; however, one should be prepared for files to be deleted entirely in the worst-case scenario where they cannot be purged of viruses.\\n\\n2. Worm\\n\\nWorms are a type of malware that is self-replicating, and are commonly delivered via e-mail. They are known for spreading quickly from system to system, to the point where one compromised user can infect an entire network; this process becomes entirely automated, with no user action required to activate a worm after it has begun to spread.\\n\\nFor protection against worms, it is vital to thoroughly examine every e-mail you receive, in order to ensure that the sender is legitimate. Only then would it be considered safe to open any included attachments.\\n\\n3. Trojan\\n\\nTrojans are also the most common type of malware being used today. They can be delivered via e-mail or malicious websites, most notably popups disguised as fake antivirus programs claiming that your computer system is infected and suggesting that antivirus software be downloaded. In reality, complying with this download request will install Trojan malware.\\n\\nThe important consideration to make regarding Trojans is that users are required to activate them; as such, remember to take all popups you encounter online with a grain of salt, especially if they are making claims regarding the state of your computer. It is better to make closing all popups immediately your instinctual reaction, as it is simply better safe than sorry.\\n\\n4. Ransomware\\n\\nThis type of malware takes user data, encrypts it and holds it hostage until some form of payment is made. The sophistication of ransomware is such that it can analyze users before it attacks, scanning to see how much they can realistically afford to pay as well as for any backups they have.\\n\\nThe best protection against ransomware is to make frequent offline backups that are kept separate from your computer; this ensures there is no chance of them being compromised by malware.\\n\\n5. Malvertising\\n\\nMalvertising is malware that is delivered via online advertisements. Whether cybercriminals pay for ads themselves or infect legitimate ads, all it takes is one click for a harmful payload to be delivered.\\n\\nIn order to protect yourself from malvertising, you must be wary of clicking on any ads while browsing online; even if you believe them to be legitimate, and are interested in them, you can visit the sites by other means instead of clicking directly. In addition, keep yourself up-to-date regarding known malvertisements that are circling the web with a simple Google search.\\n\\nThomas Leen reminds individuals and businesses to implement the necessary safety precautions on your computer system, to mitigate any breaches in personal data.',\n",

              "   'In this write-up, you will get to know about #CTF, Challenges, Tools for solving the #CTF challenges, Practice Platforms, Resources and Youtube Channels for #CTFs\\n\\nWhat is #CTF?\\n\\n#CTF is the abbreviation for “Capture The Flag”. #CTFs are the challenges in which you just find the #Flag from your #Hacking Skills. The goal of CTF is just finding the Flags.\\n\\nThere are three common types of CTFs : i) Jeopardy Style CTFs, ii) Attack-Defense Style CTFs & iii) Mixed Style CTFs.\\n\\nJeopardy Style CTF :\\n\\n#Jeopardy-style CTFs has a couple of questions (tasks) in range of categories. For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary or something else. Team can gain some points for every solved task. More points for more complicated tasks usually. The next task in chain can be opened only after some team solve previous task. Then the game time is over sum of points shows you a CTF winner. Famous example of such CTF is Defcon CTF qualifiers.\\n\\nAttack-Defense Style CTFs :\\n\\n#Attack-Defense Style CTF is another interesting kind of competitions. Here every team has own network(or only one host) with vulnerable services. Your team has time for patching your services and developing exploits usually. So, then organizers connects participants of competition and the wargame starts! You should protect own services for defence points and hack opponents for attack points. Historically this is a first type of CTFs, everybody knows about #DEF CON CTF — something like a World Cup of all other competitions.\\n\\nMixed Style CTFs :\\n\\n#Mixed Style CTF is a mix style CTF of Jeopardy and Attack-Defense. Mixed competitions may vary possible formats. There can be an attack-defense competition having a few jeopardy tasks set as bonuses or a jeopardy competition with a global task including an attack-defense dynamic. It may be something like wargame with special time for task-based elements (e.g. #UCSB iCTF).\\n\\nChallenge Types\\n\\ni) Cryptography\\n\\n#Cryptography involves encrypting or decrypting a piece of data.\\n\\nTools :- CyberChef, FeatherDuster, Hash Extender, padding-oracle-attacker, PkCrack, RSACTFTool, RSATool, XORTool, Cryptii, Keyboard Shift, and many more.\\n\\nii) Steganography(Stego)\\n\\n#Steganography is tasked with finding information hidden in files or images.\\n\\nTools :- StegCracker, Steghide, Openstego, Stegsolve, Online stego tool, and many more.\\n\\niii) Binary Exploitation/pwn\\n\\nIt is basically exploiting a binary file and exploiting a server to find the flag.\\n\\nTools :- readelf, formatStringExploiter, DLLInjector, libformatstr, and many more.\\n\\niv) Reverse engineering\\n\\n#Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format.\\n\\nTools :- ltrace, Hopper, Binary Ninja, gdb, IDA, radare2, Ghidra, apktool, Androguard, and many more.\\n\\nv) Web\\n\\nTools :- BurpSuite, Commix, Hackbar, Raccoon, SQLMap, DirBuster, gobuster, nikto, wpscan, CloudFlare Bypass, Edit This Cookie, File or Directory(robots.txt, /.git/, /admin/), and many more.\\n\\nvi) Forensics\\n\\n#Forensics challenges can include file format analysis, steganography, memory dump analysis, or network packet capture analysis. Any challenge to examine and process a hidden piece of information out of static data files (as opposed to executable programs or remote servers) could be considered a Forensics challenge.\\n\\nTools :- split, pdfinfo, pdfimages, pdfcrack, pdfdetach, Keepass, Magic Numbers, hexed.it, foremost, binwalk, Repair image online tool, photorec, TestDisk, pngcheck, pngcsum, Registry Dumper, Dnscat2, pefile, Wireshark, Network Miner, PCAPNG, tcpflow, PcapXray, qpdf, Audacity, sonic visualiser, ffmpeg strings, file, grep, scalpel, bgrep, hexdump, xxd, base64, xplico framework, zsteg, gimp, Memory dump - volatility, ethscan, and many more.\\n\\nvii) Miscellaneous(Misc)\\n\\nMany challenges in CTFs will be completely random and unprecedented, requiring simply logic, knowledge, and patience to be solved. There is no sure-fire way to prepare for these, but as you complete more CTFs you will be able to recognize and hopefully have more clues on how to solve them.',\n",

Instead of covering a chapter of the Pentest+ book and two HTB machines, we had a special guest, Tom Levasseur, hold a cyber security challenge!\\n\\nThe challenge simulated a realistic vulnerable environment where participants competed in teams to enumerate the network and exploit vulnerable services to gain initial access to the DMZ. They then had to chain vulnerabilities together to pivot to the Office and IT networks.\\n\\nThe following image shows Tom explaining the layout of the network.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that the participants had a lot of fun putting all the skills they learnt in the past sessions to use! It was a great opportunity for them to get hands on experience in breaching a realistic environment.\\n\\nWe would like to thank Tom for all the effort and time he put into this and we look forward to having him hold another challenge in the upcoming weeks!\\n\\nNext week, we’ll go back to our usual schedule and cover chapter 8 of the Pentest+ book and the Active (Windows) and Irked (Linux) HTB machines.',\n",

              "   \"Nowadays we frequently hear about high profile data breaches, stolen passwords, database dumps etc. With the rise in technology and the usage of “smart” devices and systems, the internet has become a reservoir of huge amounts of private, confidential and sensitive data. This has also become a playground for hackers and cyber criminals who hijack personal data and systems and use it for their benefit.\\n\\nWhile there are many ways of securing various online accounts and such, the number of cyber crimes happening all over the world doesn’t seem to be slowing down.\\n\\nWhat is Two-Factor Authentication or 2FA?\\n\\nTwo-Factor Authentication or 2FA, also called as two step verification is a convenient and necessary way to boost security by adding an extra layer of protection before logging in to any account.\\n\\nWhy do we need 2FA?\\n\\nWe need it because passwords are not really safe. In the aftermath of any database breach or password dump attacks, the most common passwords being used by people are embarrassingly poor. Passwords like ‘password’,’123456' are still very commonly used and are easily susceptible to attacks by even amateur hackers. The reason people use these simple passwords might be due to a lack of security awareness, having too many accounts and thus too many passwords to remember or just laziness.\\n\\nThe increasing availability of low cost high power computing machines also enable hackers to crunch through large number of passwords and execute brute force or password spray attacks as well.\\n\\nNowadays, even with a simple online search, scammers can easily obtain some level of personal information about any user. This has made it relatively easy to execute personalized and convincing phishing attacks on unsuspecting users. Users then divulge their credentials and their accounts are easily compromised.\\n\\nAll these reasons have made the traditional username-password method of logging in insecure.\\n\\nHow does 2FA work?\\n\\nWhen the user desires to log in to any specific online platform, the user first enters the username and the password. Even when the credentials provided by the user are correct, access is not granted. The user then requires to enter some additional information to prove his identity. This additional information could be a security question that only you know the answer to, some bio-metric data (fingerprint, iris scan, etc) and so on.\\n\\nTherefore 2FA acts as a safety net for your account. Even in the case of a password breach, the attacker is not granted access to your account.\\n\\nVarious Authentication Factors\\n\\n1. Knowledge factors\\n\\nKnowledge factors are the most commonly used form of authentication. In this form, the user is required to prove knowledge of a secret in order to authenticate.\\n\\nA password is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication. This is the most commonly used mechanism of authentication. Many multi-factor authentication techniques rely on password as one factor of authentication. Variations include both longer ones formed from multiple words (a passphrase) and the shorter, purely numeric, personal identification number (PIN) commonly used for ATM access. Traditionally, passwords are expected to be memorized.\\n\\n2. Possession factors\\n\\nPossession factors have been used for authentication for centuries, in the form of a key to a lock. The basic principle is that the key embodies a secret which is shared between the lock and the key, and the same principle underlies possession factor authentication in computer systems. A security token is an example of a possession factor.\\n\\n3. Disconnected tokens\\n\\nRSA SecurID token, an example of a disconnected token generator\\n\\nDisconnected tokens have no connections to the client computer. They typically use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which is manually typed in by the user.\\n\\n4. Connected tokens\\n\\nConnected tokens are devices that are physically connected to the computer to be used. Those devices transmit data automatically. There are a number of different types, including card readers, wireless tags and USB tokens.\\n\\n5. Software tokens\\n\\nA software token (or soft token) is a type of two-factor authentication security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services. Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a desktop computer, laptop, PDA, or mobile phone and can be duplicated.\\n\\n6. Inherent factors\\n\\nThese are factors associated with the user, and are usually biometric methods, including fingerprint, face, voice, or iris recognition. Behavioral biometrics such as keystroke dynamics can also be used.\\n\\nCommon types of 2FA\\n\\nAt some point most people would have used 2FA in there daily lives. Whether it is while entering a One Time Password (OTP) that is sent to your mobile device or some sort of a push notification that is commonly used with google mail nowadays.\\n\\nHardware Tokens\\n\\nExample of a hardware token.\\n\\nEvery time the user wants to login to an account they check for the numeric code that refreshes periodically on a small hardware key like device.\\n\\nMany hardware tokens contain an internal clock that, along with the device’s unique identifier, an input PIN or password, and potentially other factors, is used to generate a code, usually output to a display on the token. This code changes on a regular basis, often every 30 s. The infrastructure used to keep track of such tokens can predict, for a given device, what the proper output will be at any given time and can use this to authenticate the user.\\n\\n2. Software Tokens\\n\\nExample of 2FA via a mobile app\\n\\nThe user has to install an application on their PC or smartphone. The app will then display a numeric code that refreshes periodically.\\n\\nThe app is built in such a way that the unique OTP will refresh periodically and activate the account.\\n\\n3. SMS Text message based.\\n\\nAfter collecting input username and password, the site sends an OTP to the users mobile device which is then verified.\\n\\nOne-Time Password (OTP) is a technological mechanism through which a single-use password is generated and sent to the registered mobile number for the user to access the website. Many products and services like internet banking portals often use the OTP mechanism to ensure the authenticity of the user and prevent identity thefts.\\n\\n4. Push Notification.\\n\\nExample of push notification.\\n\\nThe site sends the user a push notification indicating the account activity and the user then verifies it.\\n\\nWhy is it important?\\n\\nWhile it does require a little more time for the log-in process, it provides a much stronger defense for your account. If your password is compromised and you have 2FA activated on your account — the hacker cannot gain access. They need both levels of authentication.\\n\\nIs 2FA comlpetely secure?\\n\\nWhile it does improve security by not solely relying on a single mechanism to authenticate users, 2FA can still be vulnerable. For example, in the case of hardware tokens, the safety does depend on the security specifications and quality set by the manufacturer.\\n\\nThe account recovery option might also be misused by attackers to avoid the 2FA authentication mechanism.\",\n",

              "   \"Lessons from a Cartoon Day Trader\\n\\nExplaining all the nuances of stock, options, or cryptocurrency trading would be redundant because every trader has a unique style that makes or break them. In the following, I’ll highlight the collective opinion of the people I’ve met who claim to be in the green.\\n\\nWarren Buffet is the father of modern stock analysis and his success was built the hard way, from the age of 11 he picked up encyclopedias and began reading. If understanding markets was a game his name surely would be on the top of the leaderboards.\\n\\nBuffet built his fortune by being on the winning side of trades much more often than not. He is a man of calculation.\\n\\nA unique breed of trader compared to that of bitcoin day traders. Not everyone is like Buffet. When he buys up shares he is looking to hold onto them for long periods of time and change how they do business.\\n\\nHis financial analysis style while valuable to know is not very applicable to other styles of trading that are faster paced and less about the intrinsic value fo a company itself.\\n\\nDay trading is only holding onto an asset for minutes to sometimes a few days, and Swing trading is about holding onto portions of a portfolio for several days to a few months.\\n\\nMarkets end up boiling down to a handful of winners and a larger group of losers, but because people trade on different time frames there is room for you so long as you build a strategy.\\n\\nYou can have more losing trades than winning trades and still be in the profit.\\n\\nDon't use too many technicals\\n\\nThere are a large variety of tools to be used with trading but the fact is most of them tell you what has happened and not what is going to happen.\\n\\nThese extrapolations you make early on will be the building blocks to being a smarter trader. So instead of searching for the magical combination of Volume, Moving Averages, Stochastic RSI, MACD, Ichimoku, or identifying Eliot waves.\\n\\nTake a step back, and build on less first, because many of the tools that traders use to identify trends are just visualization of the data in front of you.\\n\\nSo the first lesson in trading is learning how to draw trend lines, support, and resistance. Which is really just your interpretation of price action.\\n\\nLimit your losses\\n\\nWhen you enter a trade you don’t just set it and forget it for a random amount of time then hopefully you’ve made money when you come back.\\n\\nYou enter with a timeframe in your mind and what you feel the price will do within it. If it doesn't then exit at what you find to be an acceptable loss for the return you had hoped for.\\n\\nYou wouldn’t risk 80% of your bankroll in poker on a pair of spades pre-flop would you?\\n\\nEveryone has different levels of acceptable risk, and learning what yours is early on is a fundamental part of growing as a trader. The notion that only very risk-loving people succeed in trading is a barrier to entry, in fact, most if not all successful traders are very cautious in every trade they enter.\\n\\nLimit orders and market orders exist for a reason. Upon entry and exit of a trade, you should never just buy an asset for its market price. If you truly have done your homework you’ll know what price you’d want it at and will wait for it to buy and sell.\\n\\nYour gut instinct is probably right\\n\\nIf you feel its too late to enter into a trade then it is.\\n\\nJust leave it at that, bankrolling on a whim is how people stop being traders. Sure you might’ve seen or heard of someone who got very lucky, but those types of trades are generally longer-term investments. They aren't risking it all as often as you think.\\n\\nThey most likely built those decisions on financial analysis, not technical analysis. So be hungry, not foolish.\\n\\nStart out paper trading\\n\\nThis is pretty sound advice that new traders often don’t listen to. Paper trading is using fake money to trade stocks or cryptocurrencies and many platforms offer it.\\n\\nYes, it’s exciting to learn a new trick and apply it into your strategy but until you’ve tested your method in real markets it's as good as guessing.\\n\\nAnother way to do this is to simply use a journal or type out your thoughts directly on sites like tradingview and once you make your analysis you can view your ideas later and see how they panned out.\\n\\nTradingview is also a great place to connect with other traders and learn from their success and mistake but be wary because you can delete failed ideas.\\n\\nThis is why it's important to build your own strategy. Instead of joining a paid community in order to get signals from them.\\n\\nWhile you can join these types of groups in order to learn, you should never blindly follow other traders. That is because they may just be using their influence on social media networks in order to influence markets or worse fake profits.\\n\\nA healthy dose of a nhilism is needed in trading.\\n\\nRecord even your losses\\n\\nIt goes without saying that even the best make bad trades but if you write them down and keep track of every trade you make even 15 1% losses can be hedged against one 15% profit.\\n\\nAt the end of the day if you’re trading around your life savings you’re probably going to lose it because trading too often becomes an emotional experience. Learn how to take hits on the chin and you’ll greatly accelerate your path towards success.\",\n",

Make your repayments on time.\\n\\nEnsure that your income is greater than your expenses. The best way to ensure this happens is to make sure that you can actually afford the loan repayments before you sign up. You and only you are the best judge of this based on your spending behaviour. If you do get yourself into a bit of a bother, its wise to talk to you lender as soon as possible to discuss possible hardship arrangements.\\n\\n2. Don’t make unnecessary loan applications.\\n\\nWhenever you make a loan application, it is recorded against your credit history. Too many and it will give the impression that you are on a credit binge or making numerous applications because you are being declined. When you do make an application, make sure it is the right product for you and you have every chance of it being approved. It would be a waste of your time (and enquiry on your credit record) if the product was never right for you or you were never going to be approved. Get as much information on the product and provide as much information about you to the lender to get a good gauge before you officially apply. With home loans, consider using a mortgage broker.\\n\\n3. Reduce your debt levels.\\n\\nIf you pay interest only, you’re never going to pay down your loan. Make sure you are paying principal and interest and if possible make additional repayments either as a once off lump sum or just incorporate into your regular repayments. When interest rates drop, continue making the same previous repayment. When you get a tax refund, pay it into your loan. When you get your bonus, pay it into your loan. Always be on the lookout for a cheaper interest rate whether its with your own lender or possibly refinance to an alternative lender.\\n\\n4. Increase your income.\\n\\nGet that promotion. Negotiate a raise. Get that weekend job. Start that side hustle. Airbnb that spare room. Be a Uber driver at night. Rent your car out on Car Next Door. Start that gig on freelancer.com. We live in an age where you can earn money from so many different avenues which were not available even ten years ago. Don’t ignore those opportunities.\\n\\n5. Buy good quality real estate.\\n\\nReal estate prices do not always go up. Pick good quality real estate and prices will still not always go up, but at least there’s less chance of it going down. In Australia, houses are nearly always better than units. A crappy house on the best street is nearly always better than the best house on a crap street. Don’t just get into the market for the sake of getting into the market, quality matters.\\n\\nThat’s it…\\n\\nNow go forth and conquer your personal finance goals!!\\n\\nThanks for reading! 😊 If you enjoyed it, test how many times can you hit 👏 in 5 seconds.

              "   \"As this is not some sort of a clickbait, it’s actually a true reality, imagine your favorite Avenger superpowers, now imagine it’s gone, in this article that I hope won't take few hundred of words, I will try to sum it all and talk in short and long about Money, Cryptocurrencies, Digital money and all the hype that goes around it, from my perspective and depending on logical, historical and social context as I believe they should be part of today's equation.\\n\\nThus, before starting out this journey, I believe a money 101 is needed, so buckle up and let’s start this journey …\\n\\nMoney 101 :\\n\\nWhat defines money? and what makes things valuable ? to be honest, no one actually knows, when this money syndrome made it’s cut inside within our lives and took this weird and bizarre place, which started wars, made other countries invade and kill other nations for the sake of it, but we know that everything started with trade.\\n\\nTrending Cryptocurrency Hub Articles:\\n\\nTrade was the common way to exchange goods among the ancient tribes, passengers and nations, you’ve cereal, I’ve cow meat, let us exchange, let us switch this valuable asset I’ve and you got, for each other sake, and typically we’re done, we’re literally done as I don’t need to be worried about anything but on how I can and i will consume/save my current assets and make it last.\\n\\nGuys, just trust us, we are the Dollar.\\n\\nIn a quick trip back in time to the discovery of Iron, Gold and precious materials, no one actually knew or decided that this piece of dirt is valuable, people did it, if you will think of it, you will find out that what we call bills (which is exactly what money is, a piece of paper or a bill that surprisingly have a value) or currency is an agreement that many people or a set of group within a powerful organization — which typically didn’t exist in its current new form nearly 150 years ago — agreed that it holds a value, and that’s exactly how economist define money, to begin with.\\n\\nFast forward to modern times and with that I mean pre 1950 historical era, currencies, or the name of a bill or notes or the name of a piece of paper that is being printed from a given authority, took its power and glory from a direct matching between the printing organization or authority and it’s reserve of Gold or Silver, till 1971, which marked a huge transition of its kind, which first started by the US Federal Reserve saying that the US Note or Bill is not longer associates its value to its reserve of Gold or Silver, but by a direct “Trust” or “Faith” in the US Government, which means in a plain words : Guys, just trust us, we are the Dollar.\\n\\nWhy should we change again?\\n\\nThis is not the case with US Dollar only, it’s mainly the case for every other currency, but I don’t want to put my input in the matters as I’m not, by any means an expert or economist, but I believe that the question that the old generation should ask is :\\n\\nWe made an agreement before, to print this useless papers under the condition of a direct match between our and your reserve of Gold and Silver, which we actually agreed on many many decades ago that they are valuable, why should we change that again?\\n\\nThe answer is not that overwhelming, we all know the place or status the US has got post-WWII which made all the difference, so we don’t need to mention them here or today, so let’s just move on.\\n\\nBanks & Money in modern times.\\n\\nIn less you were in a coma or living in a banker, away from any kind of communication, internet or human contact in the past 20 years, you will typically figure out that, the Internet shaped the way we’re dealing and handling money, as a new type of Trade that relies on the power of data transaction and fast bandwidth, transformed the way we shop, and buy our daily needs of food, drinks and even believe it or not toilet paper.\\n\\nSo the money industry is trying to keep up, but this keeping up process relies on one thing, these things on its new form, also didn’t exist 150 years ago and is called Banks.\\n\\nLet me be perfectly clear, I do hate my bank, no one actually loves his bank except if you’re the owner of a bank, so banks job is to keep, allegedly your money safe in one place and give you access to it, whenever you seek and give you a heavenly blessing that calls, Credit.\\n\\nBanks generally control the money scene everywhere, they are the authority or the Man when it comes to money industry, and in some cases, they control even governments as not so surprisingly, huge banks land money to a total country or countries with interest, so you can imagine how powerful and how they can be so controlling when it comes to money, and trust me, they won’t tolerate any changes in the system, as they control its matrix.\\n\\n“Remember, that money is of the prolific, generating nature. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on.”\\n\\n― Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\\n\\nBut now, you might ask me Houssem, why we’re talking about Banks, we want to hear about Cryptocurrencies and that new catchy stuff, unfortunately for you and for us, everything is interconnected, story short, the financial system relies on Banks for those transactions that go from one end to the other end of the globe, and they charge you a fee for it so here’s a simple equation for you :\\n\\nNormal Bank Transaction\\n\\nPerson A sends 100 $ to Person B Scenario will likely be that the bank that will handle this transfer will take around 5 to 10% as fees, this fee is what keeps banks alive among other services that they provide just to keep your account active within their system. so imagine, how hard they will go, if for instance, a new system that wants to take those not so 150 years old Institutions out of business on it’s new form.\\n\\nWhat has been proven is that lobbying worth it, and lobbying pays off, Banks, in general, are pretty good at it, that’s why we see so many political laws and states decisions that in some sort in favor of the banking system which is absurd as we know any government should do exactly what best for its people which will give you a brain freeze 🤯.\\n\\nStop for a moment and just imagine, how will you feel, if you lost control even for a second over your vital organs, the system highly depends on a certain circulation handled by a financial system that us highly available, and almost present and require to a certain extent the human factor, which means for me a Software engineer as trouble.\\n\\nSo the main takeaways now are :\\n\\n1 — Banks typically handles the money scene.\\n\\n2 — Money value is what people or organizations agree on giving, which makes it bias to personal judgment.\\n\\nKeep the points we mentioned in mind and let's keep pushing forward as we’re going to ask questions that won’t make any sense as they are actually with no direct answer and you guessed it right, I will be talking about Crypto!\\n\\nCrypto-Ideology [^_^]\\n\\nBring the power back to the people, removing the middleman and send money in click to the other side of the planet, or maybe in the future, in an intergalactic transaction, crypto, in short, is the new kid on the bloc.\\n\\nThe kid actually is growing up, the kid knew some bullies and kid went to the gym and bulked up and now the kid is kicking shoulders 😇 (as I want to keep the PG13 free)\\n\\nBut, on the serious side, Crypto relays on a set of technologies that is called Blockchain, yeah yeah blockchain is everywhere now, it’s now what every system from voting to chatting to even requiring toilet papers is trying to use, but not everyone knows how to really use it, but for the sake of this article, Blockchain is the technology, and Cryptocurrency is the usage of this technology in the financial system.\\n\\n“Fact You Need To Know About Cryptocurrency — The first Bitcoin purchase was for pizza.”\\n\\n― Mohsin Jameel\\n\\nCryptocurrencies offer new promises, it offers security, and mostly speed, this last is what interest people the most despite the reputation ruining of using them for Hackers and underground markets, because, well, its just a token, a collection of numbers and characters that floats in the matrix, arguably the most famous one of them all is Bitcoin.\\n\\nNow, we will have a new equation and more questions to ask, if this is a currency, can I use it to buy milk? (I'm trying to lower my toilet paper purchase example) and who will take it? I mean should I have it? how I can consume it? is it real money? why Big Banks and Governments are against it? and why in the World this Bitcoin thing worth 11k USD (as of the time of writing this article).\\n\\nI will leave some resources and articles for you to read on how it works out of the box, but let’s digest the Social-economical side of it :\\n\\n1 — No BANKS!\\n\\nSo this Blockchain or ledger will replace your bank, and it will replace for sure the 5 Business day of processing and money sending from sender to receiver.\\n\\n2 — No Fees (in most cases)!\\n\\nWe typically going to remove the fees part of the equation, as the transition will be instant.\\n\\n3 — Mobile!\\n\\nOhh you have no idea how much this is vital to us in the 3rd world, as technical Banks here don’t even have a good or even mediocre Mobile Application, so being able to pay with Mobile devices is extremely tempting.\\n\\n4 — Global !!!\\n\\nTypically, there’s no border, means you can send money to whoever you want and anywhere you want.\\n\\nDisclamair : Sadly this part is what scares people and Gorvermants out, because of bad usages of this final .. which is very sad.\\n\\nNow, let me explain why this Blockchain is an alternative to old payment and old money, thus money 2.0\\n\\n1 — This industry is highly regulated:\\n\\nYou’ve no idea the compliance part that those FinTechs are trying to be toward regulations, and global Anti Money Laundering laws, which keep us all safe from bad usage of this technology.\\n\\n2 — No Technological boundary :\\n\\nYou will be the first one who will take the best of the best when it comes to technology exploitations as FinTech are startups in heart and thus, using latest technological brands is kinda the way they do business.\\n\\nAfter clarifying that out, let’s me ask more question that I hope will create a sort of chaos within your Brain as you will (hopefully) try to answer :\\n\\n1 — Why we don’t agree on changing the system again and use Cryptocurrencies as we did before while using Gold, Silver to printed Bills?\\n\\n2 — Should we really listen and comply with the old system as it’s old, but proven to be more blocking then working?\\n\\n3 — What can be next to us? what are uses cases and how we can always keep this safe, trustable and valuable?\\n\\nTill we have more answers and even larger questions, let's just agree to think about this Money syndrome and simply dream of changing it and let work more to make it work.\",\n",

              "   'No matter what it is you want to accomplish, being able to transmit your passion and excitement to other people will be crucial for great success.\\n\\nThink of Elon Musk, he excited many brilliant minds about electric cars and going to Mars that he gets talented people to want to work for him. Some people can chose to work anywhere they want and they chose to help someone who can transfer passion to them.\\n\\nIf you want to start a business, do something with your kids, attract a partner or change the world, you need this skill. This skill is also essential if you want to sell people something that you believe is a good product. It also works if you are selling people on a good idea, which we all are!\\n\\nHow Do You Transfer Passion\\n\\nYou should start (obviously?) with something you are passionate about. At least it should be something you can muster genuine excitement for while describing it.\\n\\nRight now, you can jot down on a piece of paper a few things you are really interested in. No matter what those things are, there are at least 10 thousand other people who are also interested in that.\\n\\nThen learn to communicate, either via writing or video, your passion. All it takes is practice. Without persistence you will not get anything. With persistence and consistency, the world is yours.\\n\\nCan You Turn Passion to Money\\n\\nIf you’re good at transferring passion and excitement about genuinely good things, then I believe that can be turned into financial security.\\n\\nIn order to do this, you will however need to learn some technical skills along the way. For example email marketing, content marketing, social media marketing, sales and more. These are not complex skills, they are skills you must have in our world. They do take consistency to accomplish.\\n\\nI am in the process of learning these skills myself. Despite getting a phd in theoretical physics and a postdoc at harvard, I recognized my financial vulnerability and became determined to build my financial security. For me and the ones I love. These skills will help accomplish this.\\n\\nWhere Can You Learn This Stuff\\n\\nWell, you can read different books, blogs, watch videos and take courses. It is best to go to somebody who is already doing it. One place to start is with people like Gary Vaynerchuk and Tai Lopez, two world class business influencers (at least according to Forbes).\\n\\nI have taken courses with Tai Lopez. I did one that costs only 1$ to start, where you get a video every day for an entire year.\\n\\nI will be reviewing this course and sharing insights with you as I learn more things. Of course, I also highly recommend you take the course directly from someone who is already making tens of millions.',\n",

              "   'Learn the rules of the game.\\n\\nA year after my near financial collapse, my manager told me about an open position, two pay grades above my level. When I told him I wasn’t qualified, he said it didn’t matter. I needed to demonstrate my commitment to advancing my career.\\n\\nWe argued back and forth until he said something that finally clicked with me. “If you want to get ahead, you have to play the game they want you to play.”\\n\\nEvery industry has its own unwritten rules, as does every business. Some seem pointless, purely for show, and often just unfair. But it’s humans who run businesses, and humans play games. Understand the game they want you to play, and follow the rules.\\n\\nBut wait, you say. Shouldn’t advancement depend on performance and results? In revenue-producing positions, like sales, it often does. Money has a way of rewarding performance. Even then, politics plays a role. But if you’re in an administrative or expense role, it’s full-on game theory.\\n\\nCommit to continuous reinvention.\\n\\nI left my full-time job in 2003 to move out west. That’s when I kicked off my entrepreneurial effort. When it crashed, I re-entered the job market, but I had been out of my previous role for over two years, leaving my skills a bit stale.\\n\\nSeveral hundred résumés later, I had landed a total of zero interviews. That’s when I decided on a radical strategy change — reinvention.\\n\\nI had been a software developer in my previous life, a decent one at best. Rather than continue to look for a position in that role, I packaged my experience as a programmer and my experience selling mortgages as a failed entrepreneur, took a few courses on project management, and leveraged all of that into a role as a Project Manager for mortgage processing software.\\n\\nIt’s the kind of job title that makes people squint as if doing long division in their head.\\n\\nThat’s the point.\\n\\nThat extreme specialization enabled me to position myself as the only person even remotely qualified.\\n\\nFive years later, I again reinvented myself. No doubt, I will repeat this strategy several times before I hang up my work pants for good.\\n\\nContinuous reinvention is a way of life. Fair or not, you cannot depend on your skills remaining relevant. Nor can you assume your skills are good enough to keep your job safe from poachers, structural changes in your industry, or declining economic fortunes.\\n\\nStart a side hustle.\\n\\nWhen I secured that miracle job in 2005, my salary barely covered the hefty price tag of living in New York City. I’ve since left, but my modest salary increases eventually lost ground to the rising cost of living and raising two kids.\\n\\nFive years ago, I started a side hustle to bring in extra money. That extra cash allowed us to divert money into savings and investment. We also made a few improvements to our home, increasing its value.\\n\\nToday, my wife and I maintain three income sources. It’s stressful and time-consuming, but it’s also necessary. A side gig is no longer a luxury but a necessity. A family of four shouldn’t need multiple incomes to maintain a middle class lifestyle, but that’s the reality.\\n\\nAct like the Richest Man In Babylon.\\n\\nThere’s a reason why the 1926 book, The Richest Man In Babylon, still tops the charts of wealth-building books. It offers simple yet practical and timeless advice such as this: “For every ten coins thou placest within thy purse take out for use but nine.”\\n\\nFor most of my working life, saving ten percent was impossible. Today, we manage it thanks to our multiple income streams. Even with enough money coming in, saving requires discipline.\\n\\nTucking loose change under your mattress won’t cut it. If you have access to a 401K with matching, take advantage of it. If not, setup another automatic deduction plan.\\n\\nTo build wealth, you need to save and invest. Your salary alone, no matter how impressive, won’t secure your long-term future. Start with 1% if you must, and then build from there.\\n\\nConsider strategic homeownership.\\n\\nWhen we shopped for our house, the lure of new construction intoxicated us. Those homes, however, were considered the exurbs — outside the traditional metropolitan area. Historically, these neighborhoods rarely held up in price appreciation.\\n\\nThat turned us off, and instead, we followed the advice of a real estate expert friend.\\n\\n“Buy the best piece of shit you can afford in a neighborhood with a strong history of price appreciation.”\\n\\nThat’s what we did. We approached it strategically, buying a piece of junk in a nice neighborhood we plan on staying for twenty years.\\n\\nOn paper, buying a home is a terrible idea. The maintenance costs alone eat up much of your equity. A saner plan would be to rent a cheap house and then put your savings towards investment.\\n\\nBut that requires a discipline few people possess, myself included.\\n\\nFor all the negatives of homeownership, if you buy in a neighborhood with a history of price appreciation, you’ll at least keep up with inflation while paying off your mortgage balance.',\n",

              "   \"Money\\n\\nGenerating Passive Income Is Hard, Here Is a Better Option\\n\\nThe highest level of financial freedom is having enough passive income to cover your living expenses. If you manage to reach that point, you can spend your days doing whatever makes you happiest.\\n\\nIf passive income is the key to financial freedom, then anyone who can enable others to generate passive income will be able to wield massive influence and make themselves wealthy. That is why the internet is full of spammy articles and videos, promising easy solutions to generate passive income.\\n\\nHere is the brutal truth about passive income.\\n\\nGenerating enough passive income to cover your living expenses takes years, if not decades. Anyone who promises to show you how to quickly generate passive income is either trying to sell you something or has no idea what they are talking about.\\n\\nIn this article, I explain the only way to generate passive income, why it takes so long, and an alternative to passive income that has the same impact and can be implemented immediately.\\n\\nThere is only one source of passive income\\n\\nIf someone is trying to sell you their “system to generate passive income,” remember an important truth; the only true source of passive income comes from income generated by investments.\\n\\nI’m talking rent from real estate, dividends from stocks, and interest from bonds. So, If someone is offering you passive income, ask them when they plan on transferring these investments over to your name.\\n\\nWhat most people think of as passive income is actually “scalable income,” which is another way of saying business income. There is no limit on how much you can earn, but you aren’t guaranteed a dime.\\n\\nI’ve covered the difference between passive income and scalable income in great detail here. The primary take away is that scalable income is incredible, but it’s the furthest thing from “passive.”\\n\\nThe holy grail of personal finance: passive income > living expenses\\n\\nWe’ve already touched on the importance of passive income. Once you have enough of it, you officially have “F-You” money.\\n\\nHaving F-You money means you have power. The power to do whatever you want without worrying about how you’ll pay the bills.\\n\\nBut here is the crappy part. Generating enough passive income to have F-You money takes years, and if we are being realistic, probably decades.\\n\\nWhy building passive income is a slow process\\n\\nThe best way to illustrate why it takes so long to build F-You money is with a simple example.\\n\\nLet’s assume the following.\\n\\nYou’re 30.\\n\\nYou make $50,000 per year after tax.\\n\\nYour annual living expenses are $40,000.\\n\\nThat leaves you with $10,000 per year to invest in assets that yield approximately 3.5% in passive income.\\n\\nTo cover your entire $40,000 annual living expenses entirely with passive income, you would need $1,143,000 invested. If you were saving $10,000 per year, it would take 38 years.\\n\\nSaving 20% of your income, starting at age 30, would mean you would have enough passive income to cover your living expenses by age 68. What I am describing has a name; it’s is called retirement planning.\\n\\nYes, for most people working a 9–5 job, they will be at around retirement age before they have true F-You money.\\n\\nNow that I have thoroughly depressed you let’s talk about the good news.\\n\\nHow you can recreate the impact of passive income without waiting 38 years\\n\\nRemember the holy grail equation of personal finance: passive income > living expenses.\\n\\nThere are two components of that equation.\\n\\nYour level of passive income. The amount of your living expenses.\\n\\nWe spend so much time discussing the first part of that equation and not nearly enough talking about the second part.\\n\\nI have another truth for you, and this time it should excite you.\\n\\nReducing your living expenses has the exact same impact on your finances as increasing your passive income\\n\\nIn fact, reducing your living expenses is better than increasing your passive income for a number of reasons.\\n\\nIt has the exact same impact on your monthly cash flow . spending $500 less is the same as making $500 more.\\n\\n. spending $500 less is the same as making $500 more. It’s more tax-efficient . At a 30% marginal tax rate, cutting $500 in monthly expenses is equivalent to generating $715 in monthly passive income.\\n\\n. At a 30% marginal tax rate, cutting $500 in monthly expenses is equivalent to generating $715 in monthly passive income. You can achieve this increase in cash-flow instantly.\\n\\nHow cutting your expenses reduces the time to F-You money\\n\\nLet’s return to our example, where you clear $50,000 per year and spend $40,000. We found that it would take 38 years to generate enough passive income to have F-You money.\\n\\nWhat if you were reduced your annual spending from $40,000 to $30,000?\\n\\nSince you only need $30,000 to cover your annual living expenses with passive income, you would only need $857,000 rather than $1,143,000.\\n\\nNow that you are saving $20,000 per year, it would only take you 23 years to generate enough passive income to cover your living expenses. That shaved off 15 years of the process.\\n\\nThere are two big takeaways from this.\\n\\nThe lower your annual living expenses, the less passive income you’ll need. Every dollar of living expenses you cut can be redirected to saving more, which helps you reach F-You money faster.\\n\\nIf you're serious about cutting your expenses, here are two articles I would recommend you read.\\n\\nHow to speed things up even more\\n\\nOnce you have cut your living expenses down to the lowest number you are comfortable with, there is another step you can take if you want to accelerate your timeline to F-You money.\\n\\nIncrease your income doing something you love, while maintaining your current living expenses.\\n\\nIf you can find a way to make money doing something you love, then your timeline to F-You money and financial freedom may be closer than you ever imagined.\\n\\nLet’s return to our example one final time and illustrate the impact of lowering your living expenses from $40,000 to $30,000 per year and adding $10,000 per year from a side hustle you have passion for.\\n\\nOur goal remained the same; save $857,000 to provide $30,000 in annual passive income.\\n\\nBy adding the $10,000 inside hustle income, you have increased your savings to $30,000 per year.\\n\\nIn this scenario, you would have F-You money in about 18 years, shaving an additional 5 years off your timeline.\\n\\nThe final step of financial freedom\\n\\nBear with me for one more moment because I have one final point I need to make.\\n\\nIf, in this scenario, you can make $10,000 per year doing something you truly love, then you don’t need to cover your entire $30,000 in living expenses with passive income. You only need to cover $20,000 with passive income.\\n\\nThat would mean you only need to save $571,000. That would mean you can achieve financial freedom in just over 13 years, even if you were starting from scratch.\\n\\nThe more money you can earn doing something you love, the less passive income you need\\n\\nDon’t obsess over passive income\\n\\nThe focus on passive income has reached an unhealthy point. You shouldn’t pin all of your hopes on the pipe dream that in a few short years, you could have enough passive income to quit your job.\\n\\nFor the average person working a 9–5 job, it would likely take until they reach retirement age before they have F-You money.\\n\\nHowever, there are actionable steps you can take to speed up that timeline and achieve financial freedom while you are young enough to enjoy it.\\n\\nCut your expenses to the lowest level you are comfortable with. Increase your income, possibly through a side hustle. Look for a job, a business, or a side hustle that you love. Every dollar of money you can make doing something you love is one less dollar of passive income you’ll need.\\n\\nFinancial freedom is not a get-rich-quick scheme; it’s a long and deliberate process. It won’t be easy, but you absolutely have what it takes.\",\n",

Her voice fell to a hush: “I love my kids, but from a financial standpoint, I regret having them.”\\n\\nMy friend is a tenured professor. She’s published books with major presses, including Oxford. People beg her to speak at conferences.\\n\\nDespite all this, her family is barely getting by. (Her husband is also a highly-regarded professor in engineering.) When she was done talking, her face glowed with shame.\\n\\nIt’s a common story these days.\\n\\nWe can’t afford to live anymore.\\n\\nHere’s something that might surprise you: The average cost of living in the U.S. far exceeds the average income of most professionals. We’re talking about nurses and social workers, firefighters and police officers, school teachers and pediatricians, even carpenters and engineers.\\n\\nThey’re the ones who keep society running, and they currently don’t make enough to support their families.\\n\\nTake a look at the average monthly living costs for a family of four. These are extremely conservative estimates gathered from multiple cost of living calculators, plus my own observations:\\n\\nHousing: $1,500\\n\\nTransportation (including gas): $800\\n\\nFood: $1,000\\n\\nUtilities: $400\\n\\nPhones: $150\\n\\nEntertainment: $50\\n\\nClothing: $200\\n\\nHealthcare: $400\\n\\nEmergency savings: $500\\n\\nTotal: $5,000\\n\\nThe median household income stands at $5,264 per month before taxes. That leaves just under $4,000 after taxes, and it doesn’t include deductions for 401K and basic health insurance — or student loans.\\n\\nAll things considered, the average household is sinking into debt by about a thousand dollars per month.\\n\\nThe average household requires two incomes now.\\n\\nHouseholds with two incomes used to have extra cash to spend on things like vacations or private school tuition.\\n\\nThat’s not true anymore.\\n\\nTwo years ago, The New York Times reported on the average incomes and expenses of parents with two children. Time and again, they found that even two incomes barely brings in enough cash, since you wind up paying anywhere from $500 to $2,000 a month for childcare.\\n\\nThe reason is simple. The average job hasn’t kept up with the cost of living. It doesn’t even come close:\\n\\nBasically, half of one parent’s monthly income covers daycare, and the rest goes to offset the cost of living. It’s pretty brutal. These days, the luckiest families break even. Everyone else is still going into debt, just not as much as they would be with a single income.\\n\\nStarting a family has become a luxury.\\n\\nCNN has a new online calculator called “How much will it cost to raise your child?” It’s fun to play with, in a perverse kind of way. Here’s how much it’s going to cost me to raise my daughter:\\n\\nAccording to calculators like this, having just one kid adds about $17,000 a year to your annual cost of living. After all, you have to feed and clothe them. You have to move into a bigger house or apartment.\\n\\nThis might explain why the U.S. birthrate is the lowest it’s been in 32 years. More than 40 percent of millennials report putting off children and buying homes because of financial instability.\\n\\nThis is going to have consequences for baby boomers. They should care, if only for selfish reasons. According to Joseph Coughlin of Forbes, it means they’re not going to be able to sell their homes. That’s important because older people typically want to downsize after they retire and cash in on their equity. Here’s how Coughlin imagines that conversation going:\\n\\nBoomer Seller: The town has great schools. Millennial Buyer: I don’t have kids. Boomer Seller: The house has three bedrooms. My husband and I have enjoyed it for years. Millennial Buyer: I live alone…with my dog. Boomer Seller: Well, there is a big, wonderful yard for your dog to play in. Millennial Buyer: It’s a very small dog.\\n\\nIn other words, not great.\\n\\nSorry, boomers.\\n\\nThe wealthy engage in financial gaslighting.\\n\\nGaslighting is when you construct a fake reality to excuse yourself from your own sinister actions and behaviors.\\n\\nAbusers do it all the time.\\n\\nHoarding wealth is a kind of abuse the wealthy inflict on the entire world. To excuse it, they construct a series of lies that allow them to blame everyone for their own financial problems.\\n\\nIt’s pretty easy to distract someone from systemic inequality and make them feel guilty about a financial situation that’s not their fault. You just have to talk about flat screen televisions and smartphones, even if those make up a tiny fraction of someone’s monthly budget. You call them lazy, and tell them they spend too much time watching Netflix.\\n\\nYou browbeat them for not investing in stocks, or pouring money into volatile assets. You shame them for working meaningful jobs that contribute something to civilization, instead of becoming rich so they can opt out of the economy altogether.\\n\\nYou accuse them of resenting wealth, and tell them they have a poor attitude toward money (whatever that means). Then you pump them full of fairy tales, about how someone made a fortune from nothing. Finally, you tell them money doesn’t matter, and that no amount of it will ever make them happy unless they learn to love themselves. It works wonders, because it confuses the hell out of people. Sufficiently gaslight someone over their finances, and they won’t know what to think anymore.\\n\\nThat’s the point.\\n\\nFinancial gaslighting is doing serious damage.\\n\\nThere’s millions of desperate people out there. If they have a job, it doesn’t pay enough. Here’s the advice they’re getting:\\n\\nInvest in stocks.\\n\\nStart a side hustle.\\n\\nGo viral.\\n\\nStart your own company.\\n\\nSpend less money.\\n\\nNo offense, but this all sounds kind of like throwing a drowning person a paddle made out of lead. It might look helpful, but it’s not. It does nothing but shift responsibilities from governments and economic structures to overwhelmed, overburdened individuals.\\n\\nIt’s great to make extra income off a side hustle, or turn your talents into a job that doesn’t exist yet. It’s great to be exceptional, but being exceptional by definition means that not everyone can do it. You don’t solve poverty and wage gaps by expecting everyone to be a genius.\\n\\nLet’s get real for a minute.\\n\\nThe economy needs baristas. It needs cashiers and servers and farmers. Society needs police officers and school teachers. It needs nurses and social workers. When someone gaslights them about their finances because they can’t pay their bills, they’re pretending we can live in a world without them. The truth is, we need them far more than we do lifestyle vloggers. The solution to widespread financial desperation isn’t to turn everyone into millionaire YouTubers and Instagram models.\\n\\nIt’s to pay them more.',\n",

              "   \"How to Make Passive Income Selling a Digital Product\\n\\nThere are many ways to make passive money online (affiliate marketing, dropshipping, influencer marketing, etc.). Nevertheless, I’ll focus solely on selling digital products.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause that’s how I make my money and, therefore, have expertise in.\\n\\nStep 1: Decide about the framework.\\n\\nI quit my job to do this. Can you quit yours too? It depends.\\n\\nAs a turbulent ENFP, I had savings of $18,000 when I quit, burned up $8,000 within 6 months of travel while I did nothing, and essentially started to put real effort into my new business once I panicked and had $10,000 left.\\n\\nWhether you can quit your job largely depends on your savings, expenses, and willingness to take risks. Overall, it feels good to have enough money to live off from a year and have a buffer on top of that.\\n\\nWhile I started like that I can attest to significantly higher stress levels once I got below this threshold and, therefore, don’t recommend it.\\n\\nWhatever you decide, don’t assume you can generate income within a few months. It took me over a year of hard work and zero cash flow to figure it all out. In the beginning, there’s too much you don’t know. No matter how good you are, you’ll inevitably make mistakes, all of which take time.\\n\\nIf you decide you can’t quit your job, after all, that’s okay. I know several people who built successful online businesses while employed. If you can afford it, try to reduce your hours (e.g. from 40 to 20). Otherwise, dedicate time on the weekends, in the evenings, etc.\\n\\nFor further inspiration and the conviction you can do it, read Jon Morrow’s story about how he became a multimillionaire selling online courses while he can’t move anything but his face. He‘s one of the guiding lights of my journey and I came back to this piece whenever I felt like giving up.\\n\\nStep 2: Decide on your niche and a product you want to sell.\\n\\nI sell Hungarian language courses. Hungarian is considered to be one of the most difficult languages in the world (along with Mandarin Chinese and Arabic). It’s also my mother tongue.\\n\\nI’m also with a partner who learns Hungarian and who started this business together with me. This gave us a unique approach and angle to other people's struggles.\\n\\nWhen you look for your niche, here’s what you should ask yourself:\\n\\nWhat is it you know only a few others know, but many want to learn?\\n\\nWhile 10 Mio people speak Hungarian, only a few of those speak English at my level and even less want to teach it.\\n\\nWhen I started out, there was one proper autodidactic online course and a few apps floating out there. At the same time, language-forums, related Facebook groups, and the Hungarian-learning subreddits had thousands of members.\\n\\nThis way I was confident I had a business.\\n\\nWhile these paragraphs are just the tip of the iceberg of my market research you get the idea.\\n\\nMillionaire online creator Pat Flynn’s book Will It Fly? is packed with amazing content to help you decide whether your idea could work or not. It’s what I used to decide if I should go through with mine.\\n\\nAlso, Jon Morrow’s article 21 Warning Signs You Chose the Wrong Topic For Your Blog will help you with the decision. Don’t let the title deter you — these will work not only for blogs but any type of topic you decide to pursue online.\\n\\nHere are the crucial things to keep in mind when you decide about your niche:\\n\\nSolve a problem.\\n\\nIf you remember only one thing, let this be it. You have a business if you help people with key pressing issues they face. Don’t start with nice-to-have things you feel or wish people might like. Solve their most painful problems and you’re guaranteed to make money.\\n\\nIt doesn’t have to be your passion.\\n\\nYou’re building passive income so you have more free time to focus on your passions.\\n\\nHungarian isn’t my passion. Don’t get me wrong — I like it and find the nitty-gritty of the language interesting. Most people who want to learn it are lovely and I love to talk to them and hear their background stories.\\n\\nMy passions are my partner and my friends, travel, getting to know myself, indoor bouldering, and writing.\\n\\nAll of them would cease to be passions as soon as I’d burden them with the enormous responsibility to provide me a living.\\n\\nPassions cease to be passions as soon as you burden them with the enormous responsibility to provide you a living.\\n\\nDon’t make this mistake, as it’ll leave you disappointed, burnt out, and dispassionate.\\n\\nYou don’t have to be an expert in your niche.\\n\\nOr, to put it differently, to be an expert, all it takes is to know more than the people who want to learn it and your willingness to advance.\\n\\nThe only key is transparency. Be honest about where you are, what you know, and what you don’t know.\\n\\nIf your niche is a topic you only got into recently, say so and take your audience on a journey with you as you learn.\\n\\nI’m not a linguist or Hungarian teacher. I base my content on my experiences with my Hungarian-learning partner and, after 3 years of being into it, my experiences as a tutor and talking to hundreds of Hungarian-learners.\\n\\nI’m dedicated to unlock and explain the most difficult grammar rules. I dug deep into my mother tongue to make it more accessible for its learners.\\n\\nNevertheless, I’m not a certified expert and don’t plan to be.\\n\\nLearners trust me specifically because of my different approach. Many of them worked with teachers before and want to try something new when they buy my courses.\\n\\nYou don’t have to be either. You can turn your perceived shortcomings into advantages. People don’t want your certifications. They’re looking for someone they can relate to and trust.\\n\\nStep 3: Start an email list.\\n\\nI cannot emphasize this enough. Most people skip this step and later wonder why their social media audience doesn’t convert.\\n\\nMy business runs almost entirely without social media. All I have is a Facebook-page of 1,000 fans which came somehow over time. I use Facebook solely for running ads (more on this later).\\n\\nHere’s why your email list will be your superpower, lovechild, and most valuable asset you ever build:\\n\\nControl:\\n\\nAn email list is the only thing you control. You’re not subject to any algorithms, policies, and changes of heart of social media providers. While only ~5% of people will see the smart observation you post on social media 30-50% of people will see what you send them via email:\\n\\nThe open- & click-rates of one of my recent campaigns. Screenshot by the author.\\n\\nAn indicator of a strong interest in what you have to say:\\n\\nAn email list indicates strong interest and, therefore, a higher propensity to buy.\\n\\nIt takes a second to follow anyone on Twitter. It takes typing, opening another tab, checking your emails, and the confirmation of your subscription to join their email list. It also takes trust. The hurdle is bigger and people who are willing to take it will be a lot more likely to open their wallets later on.\\n\\nTimelessness\\n\\nThink of all social media trends of the last 5–10 years. If I wanted to follow them all I would’ve gone crazy.\\n\\nFrom Facebook to Instagram, Twitter, and now TikTok and Clubhouse — people change and try new platforms frequently. All the while, they’ve been diligently reading their emails every day since the mid-90-s.\\n\\nWhile social media trends come and go, you can trust email to stick around and be a reliable tool to build trust, connect with your audience, and, ultimately, sell your products.\\n\\nThere are several online resources to start an email list. Author and online millionaire Pat Flynn’s is a great one.\\n\\nStep 4: Grow your email list to 500.\\n\\nYou’d think 500 people are too few to make real money. You’re wrong. I had 500 people on my email list when I pre-sold my first course and it was a massive personal success (see below).\\n\\nI’m not gonna lie, however— it isn’t easy to get to the first 500 people on your list. It took me almost a year. Although to be fair, I didn’t give it my all and tried to rush after multiple projects at the same time.\\n\\nLittle did I know how valuable my little email list would eventually become.\\n\\nEither way, here‘s how to get your first 500 subscribers:\\n\\nGive away something that relates to your product idea for free when they sign up.\\n\\nThis can be an ebook, a video series, a daily email with little nuggets of help, a PDF, or any other kind of digital material.\\n\\nThe easiest way to create a good freebie is to ask yourself this question I learned from online millionaire Amy Porterfield:\\n\\nWhat does your audience need to understand, be aware of, or believe to want your product?\\n\\nBy now, I have several so-called lead magnets or freebies and tried all of the types I mentioned above. They each work, given they’re helpful, solve a quick pain your audience has, and are related to your product.\\n\\nStart with one such freebie and make it the best you can. Don’t be afraid to give away too much value for free. Your help will pay off later. Also, in the end, each subscriber can translate directly into income.\\n\\nMessage everyone you know who could remotely be interested in your idea, and ask them to sign up for your list.\\n\\nI also hate cold emails, but you don’t have to see it like that. You don’t sell anything yet; you just want to create an audience of people who could potentially be interested in what you have to say.\\n\\nDon’t be shy to aim for the whole bandwidth of your social network. In the end, you don’t know whom other people know and whom they’ll forward you to.\\n\\nLeverage social media.\\n\\nTo build my list is the only thing I use social media for. I used my personal Facebook account to find and post my free material to all Hungarian-learning groups.\\n\\nAlso, I played around a lot with Reddit.\\n\\nMy partner spent a lot of time tinkering with Pinterest and made one article go viral there.\\n\\nThere are hundreds of tutorials for each social media channel and how to use them as a powerful marketing tool.\\n\\nWhere you put your efforts will be a combination of which channel you find easy to use and where your audience is.\\n\\nOnce people start hopping onto your list, email them at least monthly. Otherwise, the value of your list will deteriorate quickly. After all, you can’t expect people to be excited about you and your product idea if they haven’t heard from you for a year.\\n\\nYou can email them what you’re up to and come up with helpful blogposts or the helpful resources of other people.\\n\\nStep 5: Pre-sell your product idea.\\n\\nYou don’t have to build an entire product before you make money. You can generate income with a product that exists only in your head.\\n\\nIn fact, this is what you should do, as it gives you direct feedback about whether your idea is viable or a waste of time.\\n\\nHow to do this and see great results, however, goes beyond the scope of this article. That’s why I wrote an in-depth tutorial with every step of how you can pre-sell your product idea to your audience.\\n\\nAs I wrote above, I had 500 subscribers during the 6 months I pre-sold and built my first course.\\n\\nIt was a massive personal success. I made almost $3,000 before I launched it. That’s $3,000 for a product that didn’t even exist yet.\\n\\nOur sales stats on Gumroad between October 2018 and February 2019 when we built and pre-sold our first online course. Screenshot by the author.\\n\\nOf course, $3,000 in 6 months wasn’t enough to live while it was far from passive income, too.\\n\\nAt that time, my partner and I were together in this and worked our asses off all the while. While this meant tremendous emotional support, it also meant to divide the money by two.\\n\\nNevertheless, this $3,000 showed us to make money from digital products is possible.\\n\\nI don’t need fancy social media accounts and hundreds of thousand people I reach to achieve it. All I need is a dedicated audience I was now determined to grow.\\n\\nStep 6: Build & launch your product.\\n\\nThis goes parallel with the previous step. After the initial pre-sale, we saw the product idea was viable (ie. people were ready to spend money on it), so we proceeded to create the product.\\n\\nAt the same time, we left pre-orders open until launch and grew our email list.\\n\\nStep 7: Build a sales funnel.\\n\\nOnce you launched your first product, it’s time to automate the process and make the leap towards passive income.\\n\\nIt’s time to build a proper sales funnel.\\n\\nRoughly, here’s what this looks like:\\n\\nPeople find your freebie (e.g. through Facebook ads)and subscribe to your email list; They receive several emails with free nuggets of information, each of which helps them to solve their most pressing problem regarding your topic; You introduce your product and ask them to buy it for a discount with a deadline attached.\\n\\nIn the end, all passive income that comes from digital products boils down to these 3 crucial steps.\\n\\nPeople wrote entire books about email funnels. In the end, though, all you have to do is be helpful and offer a lot of value for free in your emails before you pitch and ask for money.\\n\\nMy longest funnels are 10+ emails long and span over 2 weeks. These are also the most successful ones.\\n\\nStep 8: Do flash sales.\\n\\nEvery few months, it’s time to remind your email list of your product(s). You think it’s pushy and if people decided once your product isn’t for them you should respect their decision.\\n\\nIn fact, the opposite is true. I sell a lot more products per subscriber with flash sales than through my sales funnel. Here’s why.\\n\\nPeople learned to trust you more. They received further helpful content and know you’re legit after months they spent on your list.\\n\\nMany people missed the first opportunity. They’ll be happy to have a second chance again.\\n\\nMany people weren’t as interested back then as they’re now. For some, it just wasn’t the right time when they subscribed or they were short on cash. Now is better.\\n\\nOne of my week-long flash sales. Screenshot by the author.\\n\\nSee one of my flash sales above. I made almost $5,000 within a week. All I did was send a few emails.\\n\\nYou shouldn’t overdo flash sales, however. I do them every 4–5 months.\",\n",

              "   'What a crazy and insane and tragic and awesome year all rolled into one.\\n\\nSince early March 2020, I haven’t been on an airplane when my oldest son and I went to LA to see the Lakers vs. Clippers game. It turned out to be their last game before the NBA shut down. Since that trip, I’ve stayed home and embraced Zoom. I’m no longer traveling to a constant stream of conferences, masterminds, and events. Although April and May turned stressful with food and toilet paper shortages and wondering what the lockdown held in store for the future of humanity, it was about that time I started to adapt my trading mindset to this new life.\\n\\nAnd what does that mean, exactly?\\n\\nThat anything can happen. That no amount of anxiety or stress is going to change the outcome. I stopped trying to impose my will on the environment and looked at this new global situation as a trader. Instead of focusing on what the world was doing to me, I started to view it from its perspective. What was it offering? A chance to rethink living?\\n\\nSo… I moved our family to the country, turned off the news, bought some zebras, and settled in for the ride. Never mind that the internet sucked. Just do it and assume the universe is rigged in your favor and see what happens.\\n\\nMy goal with this article is to summarize my 2020 trading journey against the backdrop of an unpredictable and historic year. I’m not going to focus on specific setups but instead on my overall P&L fluctuations, managing my ego, and what I learned. I spend more time on the losses since that is where the most learning takes place.\\n\\nWhat Happened?\\n\\nWhat was going on in my account, and what was going on in my brain during this time?\\n\\nI had some great trades. And I had some horrible trades. I made a few brutal mistakes. I made money 10 months out of 12, but it wasn’t smooth, and those two down months were doozies. You would think March would have been one of those nasty down months, but it wasn’t. My first losing month visited me in May. A nice little wake-up call. If I could summarize my year as a one-liner for each quarter…\\n\\nQ1: Started normal and quickly turned into 2008. Volatility!\\n\\nQ2: Lockdown? Close the office. There are no eggs? Are we safe? WTF?\\n\\nQ3: Wow. Big Wow. Turn that money into tangible assets and get it out of the markets.\\n\\nQ4: Fell off the bike, got back on, reached the top of the hill.\\n\\nSometimes I was in the zone. Other times everything I touched turned to shit. With the year over, I can count on one hand the number of trades I did that were perfect. But when the dust settled, my three shorter-term trading accounts ended at their highs, and I had a record trading year. This is a lesson I’ve had to relearn many times: You can make a lot of money in the markets not being perfect.\\n\\nThere is only one goal on which a trader should apply their focus: An upward sloping equity curve. Start the year at the lower left of the screen, and end the year at the upper right.\\n\\nThat’s it.\\n\\nNotice I didn’t say focus on being right or focus on trying to understand why something is happening. Or using this journey to really dig in and prove to your parents once and for all that you do have value. None of that will help you in your quest to generate an income from trading. There is nothing to prove—just opportunities to flow into and out of.\\n\\nAre you tuned into those outward-lying opportunities?\\n\\nOr are you so tuned into your own inner bullshit you don’t even see them?\\n\\nIn my shorter-term trading accounts, I’m not looking to trade a particular stock. I’m looking for high-probability moments in time. I take advantage of those moments with the right options strategy for that particular instance.\\n\\nI’ve been doing this for nearly 30 years now, and I’ve learned that more knowledge is not more power when it comes to trading. It’s all about probabilities and risk control. And if you are wrong, be wrong fast. Keep it simple and lay down those bricks in the right spot, as if you were building a house or a wall . . . always remembering that stocks rise slowly and fall fast.\\n\\nA large part of successful trading is learning when to do nothing. Learning to let go of the need to hop on the day’s hot stock. Hopping on that hot ticker is not a plan. That’s a well-laid path to eventual destruction as we become addicted to the dopamine rush. Then we start to chase the rush, not the stock. And like every dog that chases cars, eventually, we will get run over.\\n\\nScrew the rush.\\n\\nMaking money is easy. Keeping it is the game.\\n\\nAnd, as my yoga instructor has told me more than a few times, “Relax your face, John. And your expectations.”\\n\\nA Year In Review\\n\\nI spent New Year’s Day, 2021, looking over some of my journal entries from January of 2020. A few things stand out:\\n\\nIt’s great having Brittany Burns on as CEO of Simpler Trading. She has a unique set of skills and can lead effectively, with compassion. It’s taken me a little while to get into this new groove. Simpler is my baby, after all, started in a ground floor apartment in the middle of a Boston winter. Part of me still feels angst about being away from the office, but I’m truly not needed there, and it has grown beyond my skill set. I’m good at discovering and trying things with a small team. I’m not good at effectively managing a larger and growing organization. I’m excited by the prospect of having more time to focus on trading.\\n\\nI’m incredibly passionate about alleviating the pain and suffering of traders. I know this journey. And believe me, I’ve suffered. But running a company, even though it is amazing, takes a lot of work. And, it can be a distraction from . . . actually trading. The irony of running a trading company and not having enough time to actively trade every day is not lost on me. Simpler grew to a point where it needed adult help. As the saying goes, the skills that get you out of Egypt aren’t the same skills that will get you to the promised land. The current team in place is amazing—a mix of new talent with part of the original crew that kicked off this adventure. An extended family in every sense of the word, in great hands with a new leader driving the bus. I am so incredibly grateful. And in 2020, in the midst of a huge amount of global layoffs, we hired 27 people.\\n\\nFor trading goals, I wrote: “In 2020, I’m going to start with about a $1.4 million short-term trading account. This is for swing trades and the creation of income. My goal with this account at the end of the year is to have wired out 2.5% of my total balance per week, or about $1.7 million. And to end up with, after the wires, a $2 million account (or more) to trade for 2021.” As a side note, I buy and hold things for my long-term and retirement accounts, and I am not looking to wire money out each week from those accounts.\\n\\nSo, once the dust settled in 2020, how did my accounts look?\\n\\nNote: My TastyWorks account started with 60K that was lying idle most of the year. I transferred 200K in profits from my TOS account in August so that I could trade with portfolio margin. I started trading it actively then.\\n\\nIn terms of wire-outs, I ended up wiring out $12.5 million, which I put into tangible assets, experiences, and charity, and applied the rest toward taxes on the gains.\\n\\nFor 2021 I’m starting my short-term trading accounts at $6 million with the same goals as 2020 in terms of being able to generate and wire out 2.5% per week “or more.” I could sum up my trading goals for profits as follows:\\n\\n⅓ for taxes\\n\\n⅓ for tangible assets, experiences, tithing/charity\\n\\n⅓ held back for trading a larger account next year\\n\\nAs a note, I always like to add “or more” after any goal that involves a number. This opens the possibility of exceeding expectations. There is no reason to impose limits on ourselves. As the saying goes, “When you fight for your limits, you get to keep them.”\\n\\nIn terms of my trading style for my shorter term, aggressive accounts, I trade mostly options, both long and short (i.e., I might buy a call or sell a put credit spread). I also trade some futures, both long and short. My average holding time is two to five days, and I generally have three to seven positions on at any given time. More than that and I lose my effectiveness and focus. I’m an aggressive trader. I’m not looking to make 5% a year. I’m looking to make 5% a week. That means taking some risk and training my intestinal fortitude to handle the swings.\\n\\nMany people can’t handle this type of volatility, which is why I politely refuse to manage money. One of the few guarantees in life is that everyone with a managed account can handle the gains, but they all whine like a 5-year-old who lost a toy during the inevitable down month. There’s no crying in baseball… or trading. And I don’t have the time or the desire to hand out tissues and words of reassurance. Instead, I’m happy to share what I do with anyone who catches the trading bug. It truly is a journey.\\n\\nLastly, I’ve found that the biggest gift I can give myself is to go to a 100% cash position from time to time, especially over long weekends. As a trader, that is when your mind is truly free. It’s like getting a spa treatment.\\n\\nSo, let’s clear the air. Am I implying that you can have a 1,200% year, too? I’ll be frank.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThe odds are not in your favor. Hell, I don’t know if I’ll ever have a year like this again, but that’s not going to stop me from seeing what I can do in 2021. Trading is a journey about learning to get out of your own way while getting comfortable with larger and larger sums of money. As long as the journey continues, so does the opportunity for mental growth.\\n\\nWhy Not More?\\n\\nI have a friend who trades enormous sums of money for his own account. When we talk, he always asks me, “When are you going to trade bigger? It’s just another zero.” Money is what messes up people in trading. The getting of it, the losing of it, and the brutal, unspoken words, playing in the background, “Am I worth it?” It’s fun watching him trade as he doesn’t have any hang-ups around money. He inspires me to expand the boundaries of my own self-image. Why not more?\\n\\nThe key with “more” is to be conscious of it being a growth decision and not a destination where, once you get there, then and only then will you be happy. Be happy today. Be grateful today. The getting of more things won’t fix your anxiety. (I’ll talk more about this).\\n\\nThis is a path that, for many people, never really gets going, as they remain stuck in ego-based low awareness, repeating the same mistakes over and over, trapped in the hamster wheel mental constructs of their own self-image. I see it all the time. I’m conscious of it in my own life.\\n\\nExpand your mental limitations, and you expand your life.\\n\\nMark Douglas, the author of Trading in the Zone, laid it out like this:\\n\\n“Making mistakes is a natural function of living and will continue to be until we reach a point at which:\\n\\nAll of our beliefs are in absolute harmony with our desires.\\n\\nAll our beliefs are structured in such a way that they are completely consistent with what works from the environment’s perspective.”\\n\\nThere are a lot of deep thoughts in those two statements. People push back on this and say, “Making mistakes is a normal part of being human.” I get it. I make mistakes every day. But in trading, when we repeat the same emotional cycle over and over, it generates the same results over and over. Not being aware of this cycle and breaking free from it is a mistake. In fact, it’s the only mistake.\\n\\nThat’s what Mark is talking about. Get off the hamster wheel in your mind, which clouds your perspective, and put yourself in the market’s shoes. Start trading from its perspective just as you would surf a wave from its perspective and not from your own emotional prison’s perspective. Imposing our will works when training a dog or a horse. They will respond to us, no matter what our flaws. But the market is not a dog or a horse. It will not respond to us, no matter how hard we try. It’s not even aware of our existence.\\n\\nEd Seykota from the Market Wizards books said, “Everyone gets exactly what they want from the markets.” For people who are hemorrhaging money, this is a brutal truth to confront. What do you get from losing money? What is the payoff? What is your hidden agenda? This is where you have to kick the ego to the curb, or you’ll never learn the truth. And if you never learn the truth, you’ll keep losing money. Forever financing your own destruction.\\n\\nAn example of a hidden agenda? I worked with Mark Douglas, author of Trading In The Zone, for many years. One of the things we worked on was any hidden agendas I had that crept up while trading in front of a large audience in our trading room. One of my hidden agendas was the desire to be the hero, where everyone gets to participate in a big trade and is happy afterward, giving me the virtual “high five.”\\n\\nBut if a person’s hidden desire is to be the hero, they unconsciously create disasters where they can step in and save the day.\\n\\nHow messed up is that?\\n\\nThe person who is constantly putting out fires is also the arsonist.\\n\\nThe person who is always experiencing problems is the problem.\\n\\nThe person who keeps running into assholes is the asshole.\\n\\nThe person who thinks they are special because of their trauma . . . can’t let go of their trauma because they think they are special.\\n\\nDeep stuff to be sure. Our outer life is merely a reflection of our conscious and unconscious belief systems. This is why I love trading so much. In trading, there is nowhere to hide. There is just your P&L. Your equity curve is a direct reflection of how much you are trapped in your own horse shit vs. how much you are free of said horse shit and are fully present and tapped into the market and what it is offering you right now.\\n\\nWe can fool ourselves. But we can’t fool the market. It will call us out.\\n\\nFor those who recognize that they are the problem, this is a journey that never ends, leading to many positive developments as a human. Those who think the world is out to get them will continually devise situations repeatedly to prove that the world is out to get them.\\n\\nThe only person that can save you is yourself.\\n\\nNew Mindset\\n\\nTo change your life, you first have to change your mind.\\n\\nI made huge strides in 2018, 2019, and 2020 learning about why I behave the way I do. Hard-wired defense mechanisms from childhood and all that. It’s terrifying and enlightening and uplifting all at the same time. And worth every shovel full of dirt that gets dug up, whether in therapy or a plant-based journey of altered consciousness — which is sometimes the only way to dissolve the ego and see things as they really are.\\n\\nThe market is the best psychologist you will ever have and the best gauge of how you are doing mentally. When you can flow in and out of positions and take losses without a second thought, you are clean and in the zone. If you aren’t mentally clean and in the zone and find yourself stressed and hesitating — get flat and clear your head before the market rips your heart out. You’ve bumped up against an unresolved trigger, and you need to identify the emotion behind it and let it go before it destroys you through your trading decisions.\\n\\nThis is your ego’s way of showing you that you can’t live without it. Its only goal is to control you. It is easiest to do that when you are feeling pain and self-loathing.\\n\\nThe answer? Clear your head and get “present.” Anger over the past and anxiety about the future is the ego’s way of keeping us in check. When you are “present,” and you are “here and now,” then your ego dissolves and has no control.\\n\\nIt can be as simple as meditating for 5 minutes to flush your mind and get back to the present moment. Drop the past, drop the future, and focus on the present from the market’s perspective on what it is offering up today.\\n\\nI personally find listening to music keeps my mind very calm and clear throughout the trading day. Specific types of music shut down the reptile portion of your brain and quiet your mind. I like the “Mind Amend” channel on YouTube for this. “Focus at Will” and “BrainFM” are also solid.\\n\\nMonth-By-Month\\n\\nOk, that’s a lot of information, more than I originally intended. It’s time to talk about trading. Let’s dive in and take a closer look at what happened in 2020.\\n\\nJanuary 2020\\n\\nStarting balance: $1,373,456.00\\n\\nEnding balance: $2,000,369.09\\n\\nMoney wired out: $207,425.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $2,207,794.09\\n\\nMonthly return: 60.75%\\n\\nJanuary was a strong month right out of the gate. I didn’t have any losing weeks. Out of 21 trading days, I had 14 winning days and 7 losing days.\\n\\nOf course, the longer a person trades, the more they realize how unimportant the win ratio is. The only thing that matters is what your average losing trade vs. your average winning trade was? In this case, my average winning day was $73,504.50, and my average losing day was -$27,796.28. I personally find tracking by each day instead of each position is much cleaner. It also makes cutting losing trades super easy. “Screw this trade; it is hurting my day.” With a ratio like this, I could have lost money 14 days and made money only 7 days, and still been up for the month.\\n\\nIn fact, the higher the win ratio, the worse the risk to reward. Selling a 2 standard deviation iron condor works 94% of the time. But that 1 time it doesn’t work wipes out the previous 19 trades. No thanks. Anyone focusing on high win ratios ignores the fact that they are merely avoiding stored trauma related to losing.\\n\\nGet comfortable being uncomfortable. Get clean about taking losses. It’s your job, after all… taking losses. It’s your only job. You might as well do it with a smile.\\n\\n“Take the risk. If you win, you will be happy. If you lose, you will be wise.”\\n\\nBelow is the main tool I use to track my daily account progress in my short-term trading accounts. I use Google Sheets to log in from anywhere and enter my daily ending balance and see my net dollar and percent gain or loss on the day, week, month, and quarter. I’ll add a few notes to recap what I was trading, what happened, and note what was going on that day. Was I able to focus on the markets? Was I teaching a class? Were there leaf blowers outside my home office window all day?\\n\\nHere is an example from the week of January 13:\\n\\nFor this particular week, I started up nicely. We had added calls on BYND and held them over the weekend, and they raced higher that Monday. A 12.32% day to start the week! After a big day, I generally trade the next day very light, as I know if I let Euphoria take over, I’m dead.\\n\\nEuphoria gives us false confidence that everything we touch will turn to gold, so it causes us to take bigger, sometimes deadly, risks.\\n\\nOn Wednesday the 15th, I had a lot of trades on and a packed teaching schedule, with the options room at the open and a three-hour Small Account Mastery live-trading class starting at noon.\\n\\nAlthough I very much appreciate the opportunity to get on the mic and share trading setups and knowledge when I can, this particular day ripped me out of my trading zone, and I lost focus on my own positions. From my perspective, I couldn’t stop talking on the mic and focus on managing my own trades. I committed to serve everyone who showed up in the room and the class, and they had to come first. Unfortunately for me, it was near impossible to manage my trades while also fielding questions in the room and looking for opportunities there. So… I did nothing and just let my positions play out. Had I been focused on my trades, I would have cut them loose early. I gave back $56K that day, or -3.37%.\\n\\nLesson learned: You have to get a handle on this, as it is not an issue that will magically go away. On Small Account Mastery live-trading days, you can’t be in the Options Gold room as well. You have to manage your time so you can be effective in trading your own account and be effective in helping traders in the trading rooms. How to best balance this dynamic?\\n\\nConsider going flat in your personal accounts during these times? Construct your portfolio more conservatively during these times, maybe with hedges in place as well? Remember, anything can happen, and it always happens when you least expect it. At the very least, you can’t be maxed out on large directional plays during a class.\\n\\nThe rest of this week, I just slowly bled lower. I hit my trailing Net Liquidating Value (NLV) P&L stop and closed all of my positions that weren’t working.\\n\\nNote, a trailing NLV P&L stop works as follows. If you have a $100K account, and you are willing to risk $5K for the week, that means your stop-loss is triggered when your balance falls to $95K. From this starting point, the NLV stop is trailed up if your portfolio gains value.\\n\\nIf you are up $10K on the week by Thursday, your stop-loss is trailed to $110K — $5K = $105K. If your positions sell-off on Friday and your balance falls to that $105K stop loss level, it is your job to go flat or lock that level in with a hedge.\\n\\nThis strategy helps a trader lock in gains for the week, so they don’t give it all back. As a wise man once said, “Don’t lose your ass on a Friday.”\\n\\nTo clarify, this is the strategy I use for shorter-term accounts where my main objective is to wire out profits each week. I don’t utilize this strategy in longer-term accounts where I’m looking to have exposure to various asset classes such as bitcoin and gold.\\n\\nAlthough I met my goal this particular week of being able to wire out money and grow my account, I really gave away a lot of profits from being frazzled on Wednesday and never recovering from that. Going forward, continue to find ways where you can trade effectively and continue to moderate the trading rooms. You have to find a way to make this work.\\n\\nI have found that tracking my daily account balance changes has been, by far, the most effective means for me to focus on producing results and avoid the nonsense of getting caught up in the external and internal noise. Why a stock is moving is irrelevant. What I’m feeling is irrelevant. The chart pattern is even irrelevant. Yes, it may work 75% of the time, but it ain’t working this time. Don’t waste time trying to find out why it’s not doing what you thought it would do. Don’t waste time getting wrapped up in your feelings. Just let them go and stay present.\\n\\nFocus instead on what the market or your position is actually doing. Period. Not on what you want it to do or what it should be doing. Simply what it “is” doing.\\n\\nFrom the market’s perspective, not yours.\\n\\nThe market has nothing against you. It’s just doing what it’s doing.\\n\\nIf a position is not working, don’t get wrapped up in the inevitable fears and anxiety around losing. Just cut it loose and move on. So this one’s not working. What’s the big deal? Fire it and find a stock that wants the job of making you money.\\n\\nThink about it. If you owned a car wash and had 10 employees, and eight were working hard while the other two were hiding in the bathroom hitting their THC vape pen and never getting anything done while stealing cash from the register, how would you handle it?\\n\\nWould you give them a raise and pay them more than the other employees who are actually doing their jobs? Do you think this will encourage them to finally work for you? Would you pat them on the back and give them more refills for their vape? (I mean, if they were doing a great job, yes, of course, LOL). At some point, you’d free up their future (i.e., fire their ass) and find two people who wanted to do the job.\\n\\nThe quicker you can learn to adopt this same attitude toward your positions, the better.\\n\\nTrading is no different. If you have 10 positions, and two of them aren’t doing what you thought and keep losing money — fire their ass and find someone else who wants the job. Your losing positions are stealing from you. They aren’t doing their job. Get rid of them without a second thought. It’s as simple as that. “But what if they come back?” It doesn’t matter. We avoid the big loss by being strict about taking the small loss.\\n\\nYour ego wants to be right. But your ego is a narcissistic and fragile manifestation of your childhood trauma. It’s a master program trying to control you and run things from its perspective. You think it’s protecting you — when in reality, it is shoving you in the corner and telling you to shut your mouth. To let its built-in automated responses run your life in the protective manner it was designed for. “Leave me alone,” it says. “I got this. I’m doing this for you.”\\n\\nNever mind you are no longer a child and no longer need those survival skills. Never mind there’s actually nothing wrong with you. Never mind you are no longer in need of its protection.\\n\\nNever mind that your ego has become your jailer.\\n\\nAnd it has no intention of setting you free.\\n\\nEver.\\n\\nYou have to kill it.\\n\\nTake a deep breath, become present, and take control of the situation.\\n\\nWhen you are living in the moment, your ego dies. Oh, it will resurrect itself when you slip and fall into the anxiety of the future or the anger of the past. But when you become aware that you are in “moist robot” mode, just get back to mindfulness and being present.\\n\\nMoist robots get triggered and do stupid things. Mindful humans do not.\\n\\nTrading is very simple. If your position is losing money, it’s not doing the job it was hired to do. If it’s making money, it is doing the job it was hired to do. Know this . . . you are the manager with the power to hire and fire.\\n\\nIf the position is losing money, it’s the same as having an employee who is stealing from you. It’s not your fault. You didn’t know what this person was like when you hired them. You gave them a shot. But now that you see the evidence before you, their true colors, smile and act without hesitation. There is no shame in being wrong or taking a loss.\\n\\nThe only shame is in not taking action when you know you should.\\n\\nIn fact, cutting trades loose that aren’t working is your only real job as a trader—glory in it.\\n\\nBrush aside the triggers that pop up, as they pop up. Watch them with amusement as your ego throws them at you from all directions.\\n\\n“Not this time, buddy. Go get stuffed.”\\n\\nThis goes back to the only thing that matters in trading: creating an equity curve that goes from the lower left of my screen to the upper right.\\n\\nI’ve also found that wiring out money each week automatically dials a human brain into the proper trading mindset. It makes it real instead of a video game. It turns it into a business. I like to keep a few $100 bills on my desk to remind me that my job is to produce a tangible outcome — not to prove to the world that I’m right. It also makes me quick to cut those losing trades without mercy if they violate their job description.\\n\\n“Hey, AAPL calls, our objective is to make 2.5% this week, and you aren’t doing your job. You are interfering with that goal. You’re fired!”\\n\\nIt makes taking losses feel good. Like you are doing the job for which you were hired. The hardest thing in trading is keeping this mindset front and center all of the time. When you lose focus, your ego grins ruefully and steps back in to take over. At that point, you are screwed until you become mindful of the present once again.\\n\\nFor my daily trading spreadsheet, I’ll also add a few notes to describe what was going on in that trading session and note my equity high and low for the week. This gives me an idea of how much I left on the table and how far against me my account went during the week.\\n\\nI also like to grab screenshots of the trades that I take so I can review them later. Taking screenshots and making notes is also important as it sears the setup into my memory and trains my intuition to remember what works and what doesn’t work. This is how you train your mind to recognize patterns.\\n\\nThe next week I was up 14%. The week after that 20%. I had a big position in PTON and a few smaller positions in TSLA and AMZN.\\n\\nMy note from that week: Trading has been really good the last two weeks, but if you push it too hard, your own psychology can turn on you. Relax. Remember, your goal is to wire out that 2.5% per week and make a little more than that in order to continue growing your account equity, even after the wire out. You don’t need to go crazy.\\n\\nAll in all, a great first month out of the gate. Now that we’ve laid out a lot of groundwork, we can start to speed through the rest of the year.\\n\\nFebruary 2020\\n\\nStarting balance: $2,000,369.09\\n\\nEnding balance: $2,029,378.20\\n\\nMoney wired out: $302,660.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $2,332,038.00\\n\\nMonthly return: 16.60%\\n\\n19 trading days: 9 winning days, 10 losing days\\n\\nAvg winning day: $90,017.38\\n\\nAvg losing day: -$47,848.73\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$237,870,66 (ROKU Impulse Trade)\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $289,980.91\\n\\nMy first trading week in February was great. I ended up with a 13% return. Mostly due to TSLA and PTON. I made a GOOGL earnings trade, and that was a bust. On February 7, I put on some bearish positions, got on a plane with my wife, Maria, and headed to India for two weeks.\\n\\nWe went to a place called Vedanta World with a group called YPO for a one-week crash course in the Bhagavad Gita. It was a profound experience for me. A one-line summary of what I learned? Attachment is the true virus of humanity.\\n\\nThe week of February 10 was my worst week of trading thus far for 2020. Each day I lost money on my bearish positions, down about 1.5% each day. Mind you; I wasn’t trading. I was just checking in on my positions from the other side of the world, and they were sucking wind every day. Why didn’t I just stay in cash for this trip? When will I learn to take a break?\\n\\nWhile Maria and I were going through the airport in Mumbai to return home, I felt a need to put on a trade to offset my losses for the week. I noticed that ROKU had earnings that day and was up big. On impulse, I bought 300 calls on the mobile platform. You can see where this is going.\\n\\nFrom my iPhone, I watched ROKU start to slide and then really puke it up. I lost $220,000 on that trade in a few hours and ended the week down 15.67%. The shame was real. My one saving grace? This is not a trade I posted in the room since I did it from my phone while going through security. Only I had to suffer. It was my own damn fault.\\n\\nThis was just an incredibly stupid trade. What to do? Get out. Relax and take the next setup. I felt 100% better immediately after exiting the trade. I was free again from my mental programs.\\n\\nI told myself: “Remember, your goal is to wire out 2.5%, there is no need to do what you did on ROKU, trading from your iPhone while going through security in Mumbai. This week is a big loss, so I’m not wiring any money out. Do I need to make new account highs each week in order to wire money out? My intuition says NO. That will be a distraction and cause you to take stupid risks to get that new high. Just proceed as normal, and wire out as you go, and focus on minimizing the downside. Every week, win or lose, wire out that 2.5%. That is your job — to make that weekly payment. If you don’t make the payment, Vinny is going to break your legs. (Metaphorically speaking).”\\n\\nFor the week of February 17, I’m back home, and I am severely jet-lagged. However, the break away from the markets was good for me, and I was in the zone, cranking out a 20% week on GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, BYND, and SPCE, as well as some long bond futures. And I sold NDX call credit spreads as a hedge. The markets caved on Friday, and my bonds went up, and the NDX call credit spreads hit max profit of $100K.\\n\\nThe following week, Feb 24–28, the markets really puked it up on Monday. I had some light bearish positions on, and that’s it, so my account was up 1.88% in the room. I’ve been telling people about the 10-day moving average of the put-call ratio and to be really careful on the long side here. Some listen. Some don’t. I’m like, “Guys, I’ve seen this movie before, and it always ends the same way. Know when to be cautious. Know when to be aggressive.” I ended the week up 1.71% and overall up 16.60% for February. Oh, and had I not lost $200K on that one ROKU trade? I’d be up 27% for the month. That’s fine; I’ll take the lessons learned and continue moving forward. Remember, fire those employees (your losing positions) that aren’t doing their job, or they will take every last penny you have.\\n\\nMarch 2020\\n\\nStarting balance: $2,029,378.00\\n\\nEnding balance: $2,070,884.00\\n\\nMoney wired out: $173,775.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $2,244,659.00\\n\\nMonthly return: 10.6%\\n\\n22 trading days. 14 winning days, 8 losing days\\n\\nAvg winning day: $120,131.06\\n\\nAvg losing day: -$183,319.29\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$581,317.04 (NQ Error)\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $323,418.60\\n\\nAh, March. I was bearish at the end of February and going into March. When the SKEW is over 135, and the 10-day moving average of the put-call ratio falls to the lower end of its range, bad things don’t always happen, but . . . bad things have always started with that setup. It just shows a market that is extremely long, with the more sophisticated participants starting to hedge. I like to think about it as follows: If everyone on the planet who wants AAPL owns AAPL, how is it going to keep going higher? The answer is, “It’s not.” You need more buyers to propel a stock price higher. Once the buyers run out, stocks start to fall on their own weight as they trigger stop-loss orders from nervous traders. Throw in some margin calls from overleveraged traders, and this can quickly turn into an avalanche of selling.\\n\\nI had no idea what was about to be unleashed, but I knew there was no reason to be long. The short side of the market is fun, but it is hard. The volatility explodes, and overnight moves can kill you. As a general rule, when the VIX goes above 30, I’m very light to flat overnight and just focus on day trades. As we headed into March, I told everyone it looked exactly like 2008. I’ve seen this before. Don’t stress; we got this. Cut your position size by ⅔ and triple your stops.\\n\\nTake the loss when it’s not working. Re-entry is only a commission away.\\n\\nThere are two schools of thought to “re-entry is only a commission away.” In an uptrend, the argument against it is that stocks can gap up huge, and if you aren’t in it, you won’t be able to get in once it takes off. That’s a good point, and it’s true. For me, it’s all about protecting the downside. I don’t care if I miss a move. But I will berate myself if I get caught in an avalanche of selling that wipes out months of hard work. As a trader, my view is I should profit from an avalanche of selling — not get killed by it. Hence I’m willing to short my darlings at the drop of a hat.\\n\\nIf a market truly starts to sell off, averaging down and ignoring reality will get you killed. How do you know if it is a mere pullback to sit through or the start of something bigger? There’s never 100% certainty, of course. For me, on a daily chart, if the S&P 500 closes below its daily 21 EMA, then I am very quick to cut losing trades. Yes, it may pop back up above. And it may be the start of a 10% correction. I err on the side of, “When in doubt, get out.” I’d rather get back in on the long side when the market structure is cleaner. After all, it just costs me the commission, and there will always, always, always be another setup.\\n\\nBack to trading . . .\\n\\nI was up 13.76% for the first week and 8.77% in the second week. So far, the month was going well. I’m not holding onto longs. I’m actively trading, long and short. Why long? In big down moves, you also get the best retracement rallies. Go both ways!\\n\\nThen, on a Friday morning, I wake up, check the quotes, and see the NQ limit up! Yes! I’m going to kill it today, and everyone who followed my trades will have a great morning. What a great way to end the week!\\n\\nWait… what? Why am I down like $400k? Obviously, there is an error here somewhere?\\n\\nOh. My. God.\\n\\nOn Thursday, I was long the NQ, and I had a GTC (good till cancel) sell order at a particular target. I ended up just closing my long NQ at the market, and… I FORGOT TO CANCEL MY GTC SELL ORDER.\\n\\nThis would have been great had the markets popped overnight, filled me, and then puked.\\n\\nBut, no, that’s not what happened.\\n\\nWhat happened is that the markets rallied, hit my order to “SELL” my NQ long futures, and filled. Since I didn’t have long futures contracts, there was nothing to offset. So this got me short 30 contracts. Overnight the NQ proceeded to move limit-up. That’s what I woke up to… a $400,000 loss because I didn’t remember to cancel my GTC sell order.\\n\\nI was shaken up, and it got worse from here. The cash session opened and, after a small pullback, I decided to buy AMZN calls that expired that day for a quick move to ease the pain of my NQ loss. Of course, what does AMZN do on a Friday? It falls. After looking great, it rolled over and died, and I watched it die, and my P&L die with it.\\n\\nMy account lost 22.72% that day. So brutal. I couldn’t recover from my mistake.\\n\\nI ended the week down 17.41%.\\n\\nMy one saving grace? The NQ trade was an error and not a posted trade, so nobody had to share that pain but me.\\n\\n(On a positive note, this is when I started to study AMZN’s behavior on a Friday and have since made a lot of money on that Friday puke pattern).\\n\\nThe last week in March, I played it more cautiously and ended the week up 3.08%, and I was still up on the month, cranking out 10.6%.\\n\\nWhile Q1 was a great quarter, two trades ended up costing me a lot of money. The first was based on impulsive stupidity, ROKU. The second was due to not canceling a GTC order in the NQ. These were two VERY PREVENTABLE mistakes. You can do better than this, Carter. Without the NQ day, I would be up 35% this month instead of 10%. Never forget that anything can happen in the markets, including the markets taking away every dollar in your account in a very rapid fashion. The market doesn’t know you exist, so it’s nothing personal. You just need to make sure you are tuned into the market and what it is prepared to offer you that day.\\n\\nApril 2020\\n\\nStarting balance: $2,070,884.00\\n\\nEnding balance: $2,144,190.00\\n\\nMoney wired out: $118,825.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $2,263,015\\n\\nMonthly return: 9.3%\\n\\nWinning days vs. losing days: unknown\\n\\nAvg winning day: unknown\\n\\nAvg losing day: unknown\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$249,913.74\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $611,531.32 (AMZN)\\n\\nFor April, it was mostly a quiet month as I didn’t push it too hard. I did have a nice trade in AMZN, but otherwise, it was quiet in terms of trading. This is a journal entry from April 4:\\n\\n“What a whirlwind. I feel exhausted. Maybe it was the hard workout yesterday? I think, though, I may have absorbed a lot of scared energy. There is a lot of panic out there with Covid-19. School is shut down. Businesses are closed. There are food shortages, and people are fighting over toilet paper. I read a few things where this is going to turn into the next Great Depression. I don’t believe that, but still, you read that shit, and part of it sinks in. My oldest son asked me if we would be ok and I said, ‘Don’t worry, we are going to be fine.’ I caught myself. Was I taunting the universe to challenge me? I mean, I think it is just an upper limit problem. (An upper limit problem is what happens when things are going ok, but your mind starts inventing things to worry about to keep you from advancing further). So, anyway, how about just act like the universe is rigged in your favor, enjoy the ride, let go of the outcome and enjoy this time on earth while you have it?”\\n\\nWhat’s fascinating here is that on April 24, I added my usual daily balance entry to the spreadsheet. After this date, I just stopped tracking it for six weeks. I don’t really remember why. I didn’t resume tracking it again until June 15, so I have to rely on my monthly statements and my journal to see what was going on here. In April, it was sinking in that the world was changing, and I was more focused on the outer world and what was going on. The markets were volatile. I was frequently up late and up early and in front of my computers a lot. I posted constant updates in the room as people were looking for guidance. I’ve seen this movie before; there is no reason to panic. It will all work out. But it was exhausting, and I think I reached my limit. I needed some recharge time at the beach, but we were on lockdown and couldn’t travel anywhere.\\n\\nI ended up with a gain in April. May? Not so much. May turned into my first losing month of the year.\\n\\nFirst, if we look at May, it is apparent that May was not a fun month to trade, at least for me.\\n\\nMay 2020\\n\\nStarting balance: $2,144,190.81\\n\\nEnding balance: $1,646,436.20\\n\\nMoney wired out: $0.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $1,646,436.20\\n\\nMonthly return: -23.21%\\n\\nNo additional stats as I didn’t track the daily changes.\\n\\nI remember May was generally a stressful month of, “What the hell is going to happen to the economy with all this lockdown stuff?” I was spending a lot of time researching whatever I could, while also trying to get effective internet going in Wimberley. Up to this time, I was still driving into the office or our “old” city house in Austin as much as possible so that I could use fast internet. The commute is about an hour each way from Wimberley, and it was getting tiring. In Wimberley, I had a point-to-point connection that was about 2.5MB up and down on a good day. My trading platform would often freeze during this incredible volatility, and some of my losses can be attributed to having tech issues. There were days where I was stuck in positions and couldn’t get out in a timely manner. Fun times, indeed. (But — I do take full responsibility as it was me who chose to trade on a slow connection).\\n\\nFrom my journal entry, it looks like my first week in May, I was down about 15%, and from there, I just got really cautious, not wanting to dig a bigger hole. I also found out that my stepbrother, who is a year younger than me, passed away suddenly due to his organs shutting down from drinking too much alcohol. It really hit me hard, and I broke down crying a few times. It was like we were hanging out in 9th grade, and the next thing you know, this? How did our paths from that point in our lives lead to this for him? WTF?\\n\\nFrom here, I started writing out things on how to make my life more simple. “Get rid of anything annoying. Let’s cut down the daily activity and focus on generating positive cash flow from trading, with minimal expenses. That’s not a bad way to spend the rest of your life.\\n\\n“This gives you the chance to relax and start structuring your trades in a more relaxed way. You can trade small and still wire out 25K a week. Do spreads. Capisce? You can relax and trade with your kids. Take this as the gift that it is; set aside your ego. Morph into a trading life of ease, which can be accomplished with the right setups and option structure if you are patient. The day trading you did in March has negatively impacted your trading, as you are still focused on quick day trades. What are you, 12 years old? There is no need for you to be as mentally tired as you are right now.”\\n\\nAfter this journal entry on May 27, I started doing an “auto wire” of $25,000 each Thursday morning. This would happen automatically whether I made money or not. I also started a 72-hour fast. I have little recollection of my trading in May.\\n\\nJune 2020\\n\\nStarting balance: $1,646,436.00\\n\\nEnding balance: $3,155,005.00\\n\\nMoney wired out: $200,000.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $3,355,005.00\\n\\nMonthly return: 103.78%\\n\\nNo additional stats\\n\\nThe biggest change in June? I got a fast internet connection out in the country. Instead of trading off 2.5MB spotty service, we finished construction on an 80-foot tower, and I now had 50MB up/down internet—huge, huge difference. Getting fast internet out in the country was a two-year project. We are starting to offer the service to our neighbors as well.\\n\\nWith the faster internet, my trading started to improve. Then, on June 13, after grinding it out for six weeks, TSLA teed up for the first million-dollar trade of the year. At that point, I also changed my auto-wire from $25,000 to $62,500 per week. This wire would go out every Thursday morning, automatically, whether I made money or not. I also decided to start resuming my daily spreadsheet entries on June 15. On June 18, we had a nice gap up in SPOT, and we closed that and headed to Colorado for a family road trip.\\n\\nWhile traveling, I put on some trades and the markets suddenly went extremely negative, as they often seem to do when I travel. I ended up down 2% on the week but only because I had a great recovery day on Friday. Once again, why couldn’t I just take the week off? I mean, I get it, I like to trade but…!\\n\\nAll in all, June was a great month. Let’s get back in the game. Turn off the news and get back to work.\\n\\nJuly 2020\\n\\nStarting balance: $3,155,005.00\\n\\nEnding balance: $3,376,688.00\\n\\nMoney wired out: $1,187,500\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $4,564,188\\n\\nMonthly return: 44.67%\\n\\nTrading Days: 22\\n\\nWinning days vs. losing days: 15 winning days, 7 losing days\\n\\nAvg winning day: $233,151.50\\n\\nAvg losing day: $298,298.42\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$732,308.75 (Overnight move in AMZN long calls destruction)\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $1,325,736.45 (TSLA)\\n\\nFor the week starting with July 6, I started off bearish with puts on SPY and lost $100K right off the bat. Later in the day, I bought 100 calls on TSLA, and it exploded into the close. I sold half and kept half. I had up days every day this week and was really in the zone. On Thursday night, I noted that I had “A lot of AMZN and TSLA exposure going into Friday the 10th.”\\n\\nOn Friday the 10th, I was initially down over $200K with TSLA gapping down. AMZN was doing well, and I closed out that position. I had some small NQ and ES futures that I closed out at the lows of the day like a noob. But I held onto TSLA and added to it, and it recovered, broke out, and went up to new all-time highs. Best trading week of the year and another million-dollar TSLA trade.\\n\\nOn July 13, my portfolio was up about 10%, and I decided to buy 4,000 shares of TSLA and then went to look for the zebras, which I had purchased the month before.\\n\\nWhen I came back from the hike, TSLA was down $150 a share from my entry. This is not something I thought would happen, and I have no excuse for not having a stop loss in place. Lost 12% that day. I never recovered from that and ended the week down 15%.\\n\\nThe week of July 20 started great, up nearly 10% on Monday. From there, I had a decent position in AMZN that tanked, giving me my biggest loss of the month, and I ended the week down 9%. The next week was steady, up 15%.\\n\\nI ended up wiring out a lot of money this month. This was for taxes as well as a downpayment on a new house we committed to in February before all the Covid-19 went down. We could walk away from it and lose our 10% deposit. But I wanted to go ahead and get the house. If we ever go back to Austin, it’s a great house in a perfect central location on a 5-acre lot with trees all over the place.\\n\\nAugust 2020\\n\\nthinkorswim®\\n\\nStarting balance: $3,376,688.00\\n\\nEnding balance: $11,360,342.20\\n\\nMoney wired out: $650,000.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $12,010,342.20\\n\\nMonthly return: 255.68%\\n\\nTrading Days: 21\\n\\nWinning days vs. losing days: 16 winning days, 5 losing days\\n\\nAvg winning day: $624,860.70\\n\\nAvg losing day: -$272,823.53\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$362,520.07\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $2,466,165.08 (TSLA)\\n\\ntastyworks\\n\\nStarting balance: $260,315.30\\n\\nEnding balance: $1,073,646.02\\n\\nMoney wired out: $0.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: N/A\\n\\nMonthly return: 312.44%\\n\\nTrading Days: 11 (Started trading in this account on Aug 17)\\n\\nWinning days vs. losing days: 9 winning days, 2 losing days\\n\\nAvg winning day: $95,742.62\\n\\nAvg losing day: -$24,176.44\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$38,290.00 (CRM, TSLA, manageable positions, though)\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $221,108.49 (TSLA)\\n\\nAugust was quite the month. For the first week of August, basically, everything I touched turned to shit, and I lost 8.03%.\\n\\nFor the week of August 10, I had some back-and-forth and ended the week up 15.08%. I lost money on AAPL and made it on TSLA. This started a streak where I made money each week for the next 2 ½ months.\\n\\nNote, on August 10, I also wired over $200K to tastyworks (TW). I had $60K sitting there doing nothing. I wanted to get a portfolio margin on that account, so I sent over more funds. I started tracking my daily account balances in TW this week as well, starting on August 17.\\n\\nOn Thursday, August 13, in thinkorswim® (TOS), I placed a 500-contract call debit spread on TSLA and posted it in the trading room as a 15% position. I also bought 1,000 shares of the stock, which is like 10 in-the-money call options. On Friday the 14th, it disappointed, gapping up and selling off, then finally rallying a bit into the close. I held on for the weekend. Below is what the 30-minute chart looked like, which is about damn near perfect. I did a similar, smaller position in my TW account. I think it was a 100-contract call debit spread.\\n\\nAlthough it was extended on the daily charts, the 30M chart was a textbook bullish setup, and this is what I was trading:\\n\\nMoving averages stacked positive.\\n\\nSqueeze early warning buy signal arrows\\n\\nReady. Aim. Fire!® buy signals\\n\\nMomentum turning back to cyan on the 30M squeeze, indicating the slight positive shift in momentum\\n\\nCup and handle pattern\\n\\nIt doesn’t get any better than this on the long side.\\n\\nOn Monday, Aug 17, TSLA gapped up, and . . . kept on going. AND TOS WAS DOWN ALL DAY! TSLA closed at $1,835 (up $186 a share on the day). It blew through my short strike, which is a great thing with a call debit spread. Now I could just hold on and collect premium decay. I decided to hold it overnight.\\n\\nIt wasn’t lost on me that, had I just bought calls, I would be up like $6 million on this trade since a call debit spread caps gains. But it begs the question, “Would I have been able to hold onto it that long?”\\n\\nIf I’m honest with myself, probably not.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Aug 18, TSLA kept going. I was quickly at 85% of the max profit on my call debit spread and realized it didn’t make any sense holding onto it any longer. This turned into my biggest trade ever, right around $3.75 million. Since my trading platform was down, I had to close it on my iPhone, which was a first. For the week, I was up 156%, just over $5 million.\\n\\nThe next week I made 21.67% to end August on a high note.\\n\\nMy $260K tastyworks account was also off to a good start, ending this same week at $460K, and ended the month up over 300%. I’m sure everyone at Tasty thought I was insane, LOL.\\n\\nThis was all a bit overwhelming and surreal, and I needed to process what happened.\\n\\nI packed up my family, and we headed to South Padre Island. I knew I couldn’t let the euphoria get to me. It was just time to catch my breath and get ready to go back to work. After a winning streak, it doesn’t suddenly mean you are special or that you’ve finally mastered the elements. It just means you caught a nice wave. Catch your breath, and go back to following your damn plan.\\n\\nSouth Padre Island was amazing. I only remember it vaguely from Spring Break in college. When it’s not Spring Break, it’s a sleepy little beach town and is the best stretch of beach in Texas. I get it — that’s not saying much — — but we were in lockdown, and you do what you can. Before this, we would schedule regular recharge trips to the Cayman Islands, where we have a condo on 7-mile beach. We love these trips and really missed our family beach time. This got me thinking about getting a beach house in South Padre. At least we could drive there without having to take a Covid-19 test.\\n\\nAt this point, I had a large amount of cash. Should I YOLO (You Only Live Once) it and try to double it again? Or take some money out and put it into tangible assets that the markets couldn’t take away from me? Namely, real estate, gold, silver, and crypto? Having done this for a long time, I had no illusions that I was now a “trading master of the universe.” I was dialed into the markets, and I followed my plan. That’s it. Will I be as dialed in next week? Will I be able to perceive what the market is willing to offer me next month? I didn’t know, and I don’t know, and I never will know. Trading is a daily psychological session to see if you are living in the present or not. Needless to say, I decided to start taking out larger sums of money.\\n\\nWriting this in January 2021, and being a genius in hindsight, I would have put it all into bitcoin and GME. As it stands, I put most of it into real estate and some of it into gold and bitcoin. In trading, I’ve talked about how we need to let go of anxiety and fear and anger in real-time, as it comes up. I’ve also learned that we have to let go of any fantasies we entertain of having the perfect genius in hindsight trade. “If only I had bought 10,000 bitcoin when it was at $1.00! If only I had bought 1,000 GME calls when it was at $20!” These kinds of fantasies also destroy our ability to act in the present moment and must be eliminated (i.e., let them go) as soon as they come up.\\n\\nAt this time, I also decided that I would use $10 million as my new “baseline” in my TOS account, and I would wire out anything above that. Makes sense, right?\\n\\nThis was a huge mistake.\\n\\nAs you’ll see, that idea didn’t last long and eventually backfired. Looking back, I realize what a huge mental shift that caused. Now I was unconsciously trading “not to go below $10M” instead of making myself available to the market opportunities. I was trading from a subtle fear of losing. And what you think about eventually comes about.\\n\\nSeptember 2020\\n\\nTOS\\n\\nStarting balance: $11,360,342.20\\n\\nEnding balance: $12,155,542.03\\n\\nMoney wired out: $3,050,000.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $15,205,542.03\\n\\nMonthly return: 33.85%\\n\\nTrading Days: 21\\n\\nWinning days vs. losing days: 16 winning days, 5 losing days\\n\\nAvg winning day: $312,727.69\\n\\nAvg losing day: -$214,356.26\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$664,712.67 (Teaching a class while ignoring my positions.

AMZN, DKNG, NVDA, SPOT. I didn’t even look at this account once today as I was focused on my class.

I did end up wiring out a lot of money to start putting it into tangibles. My goal heading into October was to keep my TOS balance at $10 million and wiring out funds above that amount for tangibles.

October was a mental game fail. First week? Up 3.13%. Second week? Up 2.97%. Third week? Down 2.07%. This was my first down week in my larger TOS account in 2 ½ months, since the week of August 3.\\n\\nNot bad, right? Very manageable swings. So, what happened?\\n\\nIn October, you’ll notice I wired out $4 million. As I’ve stated, my grand plan for October was to keep my balance above $10 million and wire out any excess profits, and put them into tangible assets. This would be my nice, easy plan for the rest of the year.\\n\\nThis came to a head on October 15. On this day, I was due to wire out seven figures to buy a beach house we had found in South Padre. I started the day at $10.2 million and had sizable positions on TSLA and RH. Both positions sucked wind, and I lost $700K that day, with my account dropping to $9.5 million. I then had to wire out $2 million, mostly for the beach house, and now my balance was at $7.5 million. This messed me up mentally as I hung onto the narrative of having a $10 million account.\\n\\nThe next week I lost $500K. I loaded up on SNOW and RH and a few other names for the weekend. That Monday turned into my worst trading day ever, and I was down $1.65 million on the day. I made $400K the next day, and then the rest of the week was a continued shit show. Up to the last week in October, I was flat on the month. The last week of October, the markets reared back and punched me in the face. But… it didn’t really do that, of course. I simply was wrapped up in my own inner perception of the world, and I had forgotten to view the market from its perspective. I was trying to impose my will on the markets. I forgot the most important trading lesson: When dancing with the markets, it’s best to let it lead.\\n\\nWhy all the real estate? I like to find properties we would like to visit and turn them into short term Airbnb rentals. This is a good family activity. There are tax benefits to having an “active” real estate status, where if you have real estate losses due to depreciation, this can be deducted against your trading gains.\\n\\nBy chance, we had many “tangible asset closings” all lining up in October, so suddenly, the pressure was on to generate real cash to cover these deals.\\n\\nSo, October was a shit trading month. In retrospect, had I not put this pressure on myself, would it have turned out better? You never know, but that was the outstanding mental factor I had to manage into the end of the month. The pressure to make money trading generally causes the most trading errors. My narrative of “keeping it at $10M” was a hidden agenda that conflicted with my ability to relax and view the markets from its perspective.\\n\\nLesson learned. Again. Next.\\n\\nNovember 2020\\n\\nTOS\\n\\nStarting balance: $4,002,990.42\\n\\nEnding balance: $5,744,439.79\\n\\nMoney wired out: $1,050,000\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: $6,794,439.79\\n\\nMonthly return: 69.73%\\n\\nTrading Days: 20\\n\\nWinning days vs. losing days: 12 winning days, 7 losing days, 1 flat day\\n\\nAvg winning day: $311,924.42\\n\\nAvg losing day: -$135,936.23\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$390,750.00 (the week before Thanksgiving was meh)\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $1,299,940.53 (TSLA)\\n\\nTW\\n\\nStarting balance: $915,852.40\\n\\nEnding balance: $1,556,197.63\\n\\nMoney wired out: $0.00\\n\\nBalance if no money wired out: N/A\\n\\nMonthly return: 69.92%\\n\\nTrading Days: 20\\n\\nWinning days vs. losing days: 7 winning days, 1 losing days, 12 flat days\\n\\nAvg winning day: $119,186.89\\n\\nAvg losing day: -$193,963.00\\n\\nBiggest Daily Loss: -$193,963.00 (Open loss in TSLA that I held, and then it rallied)\\n\\nBiggest Daily Win: $447,492.75 (TSLA)\\n\\nTo start November, I was trading slow and steady. I went into the month 100% cash and didn’t do anything on the first trading day. My main goal at this point was to clear my head, forget about October, and go back to trading and taking opportunities from the market’s perspective of what it was willing to offer vs. my perspective of trying to maintain a certain balance or make a specific amount of money for a piece of real estate.\\n\\nFor week 1, I was up an auspicious 8.88% in thinkorswim. Week 2, down 3.53%. The week of November 16 was crap. Down 19.72%. My notes just say, “Meh. Crap.” On each day. That said, some of this loss was due to hanging onto a large TSLA position that I did not close out, and it popped on Monday the 23rd. This turned into a big trade, up over $2.5 million. In tastyworks, I didn’t have the same fluctuations as I mostly stayed flat, adding the TSLA trades towards the end of the month.\\n\\nIn hindsight, I put a lot of pressure on myself to generate cash for the pending real estate deals. It should have been the other way around: first, wire out the money, then find the property. That said, I’m still a huge fan of wiring out money, and it will continue to be a regular account management strategy in my trading. What if I had a 30% down month without having wired any money out? That would have been super ugly. But losing 30% on remaining money after wiring out a lot of cash already? Not as big of a deal.

It basically took me two months to recover from that last week in October. That’s what I mean when I say, “Re-entry is only a commission away.” Missing a move is fine. Recovering from a big drawdown takes a lot of time and effort. What if I had just gone flat that last week in October and waited until things looked cleaner?\\n\\nDecember was fairly chill. Nothing too bad, nothing too great. There was one TSLA trade that I took a lot of heat on but held on, and it worked fine. It upset me that I let it go that far against me, and I count myself lucky that I recovered.\\n\\nMy notes from that week:\\n\\n“Although this week was manageable in the end, from a risk to reward standpoint, I think this was my worst week all year. Yes, it recovered, and it was down 8% on the week, but at one point with TSLA, you were down nearly 30% in open losses. That is a huge intraweek drawdown, and frankly, it was inexcusable, and you got lucky. You could have easily been annihilated on this trade.\\n\\n“What gives? I got complacent. I made huge bets that I assumed would work, and I didn’t fully accept that they might not work.\\n\\n“I was ready with the TIMING for a market pullback, and I IGNORED IT COMPLETELY. This is what I mean by complacency. Why hedge when it “never” works? With timing in place, you don’t have to go short, but if you are locked and loaded long, and you ignore that signal, then you deserve whatever beating the market is dishing out that day. You are literally begging to have the shit kicked out of you. Is that a subconscious thing where you are seeking punishment? Or just complacency?

              "   'Is the Bitcoin Bubble Ready to Burst?\\n\\nPicture via shutterstock.com\\n\\nTulip mania revisited\\n\\nI strongly recommend that you read one of my favorite books: Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles MacKay. Don’t be troubled that it was published in 1841; it’s a great book about the human psychology and the making of markets. MacKay writes that over and over again in the history of man some particular craziness, scheme, or fantasy captures the attention of the “crowd,” and after an upward spike, the bubble bursts.\\n\\nIn the early 1600s, tulip mania gripped Europe. Prices of tulip bulbs reached astronomical levels for no apparent reason. MacKay tells of a sailor, back in town after a long voyage, who grabbed what he thought was an onion, and started eating it. The owner couldn’t stop the sailor, who he said, just ate a tulip bulb for breakfast that might have paid a ship’s crew for a whole year. The sailor was jailed. (Beware: Don’t eat tulip bulbs; they may be poisonous.) In 1637, tulip prices collapsed.\\n\\nThis was the first reported bubble collapse but certainly not the last.\\n\\nAnother of MacKay’s studies was the Mississippi Company bubble.\\n\\nBy the early 1700s, Louis XIV’s long reign and costly wars had nearly bankrupted the French government. Louis arranged with the Banque Royale to pay off the national debt by opening the Mississippi Valley to investment. The Mississippi Company was formed. Since it had a monopoly on trade and mineral wealth in the French-held area of what is now the United States, it looked like a can’t-lose investment. However, the backers hyped up the profitability of the land way beyond the truth and stoked investor interest. Then they issued more and more notes to raise money. Finally, some early investors started to redeem their notes for silver and gold. As the trickle turned into a torrent, the French government finally admitted that the number of paper notes issued was greater than the value of the metal that it held and payment stopped. The bubble burst at the end of 1720.\\n\\nMackay’s book is a good first read in trying to understand human actions in bubble markets. He reached the basic conclusion that one person alone is an entirely rational human being, but get that person in a crowd and the crowd may behave in a bizarre fashion.\\n\\nOn to cryptocurrencies and bitcoin in particular.\\n\\nWhat’s driving Bitcoin’s price up?\\n\\nA year ago (February, 2020) bitcoin sold for about $10,000, and now, one year later, it sells for five times as much. Wow! Bitcoin was set up about a dozen years ago as an alternative to government issued money. It functions like money, but you can’t hold it in your hand. It exists as an electronic file. Transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger. No government regulates it, and if you lose or forget your password (key), your bitcoins are lost for ever. Bitcoin keeps its value in part because supply is limited.\\n\\nIt can be used for more and more purchases. Tesla will now accept bitcoin in payment for their cars.\\n\\nWith interest rates very low these days, some people are sitting on assets that are not earning much money and see a bitcoin investment (speculation?) as a way to put extra dollars to work.\\n\\nBitcoin production, unlike money in the United States, is limited. The U S government can print more money whenever it sees fit. Bitcoin serves as a diversification and a hedge against inflation.\\n\\nThe bitcoin’s rise has further to go argument\\n\\nSome feel bitcoin represents a paradigm shift worldwide as more and more companies see it as a legitimate currency. Elon Musk’s decision for Tesla has been referenced above; Mastercard and Apple Pay have joined in. BNY Mellon said it would hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for its clients. MassMutual bought $100 million of bitcoin in December. Is this the start of a trend or only the fear of missing out at work?\\n\\nThe bitcoin’s rise is over argument\\n\\nRight now bitcoin is a speculation. Even if many merchants accept it, some feel it will never become the dominant player in the transactions field.\\n\\nBitcoin ran up from about $1,000 to almost $20,000 in 2017. It crashed dramatically to about $1,600. Papers have been written claiming that half the price rise of bitcoin in 2017 was due to manipulation. Bitcoin is volatile and speculative. It’s had a spectacular rise this year, but who knows what will happen next year. The market for bitcoin is surreal.\\n\\nBill Gates and Warren Buffett give cryptocurrencies a thumbs down. They say it’s okay for Musk and Tesla to take a chance with bitcoin, but they caution average investors about taking the plunge. Buffett is recognized as one of the greatest investors of all time.\\n\\nAnd lastly, remember that all bubbles eventually burst.\\n\\nLessons to be learned\\n\\nDogecoin, another cryptocurrency, (there are thousands of cryptocurrencies), was created in 2013 as a joke. It recently spiked to 8 cents after celebrities started to talk about it. After the hype stopped, it dropped to 5 cents.\\n\\nAs the great Spanish philosopher George Santayana said, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,” Along the same lines Winston Churchill wrote, “If we don’t learn from history, we are bound to repeat it.”\\n\\nWarning: Buy cryptocurrencies at your own risk.',\n",

              "   \"The Fastest Way to Multiply Your Income Has Nothing To Do With Finance\\n\\nPhoto by Gabriel Tovar on Unsplash\\n\\nThe ironic thing about the fastest way to multiply your income is that you need to look away from the money. It is only when your income is very high already, that multiplying it involves monitoring your finances. If you are still in the 4-figure and 5-figure range, the fastest income multiplier is not directly connected to your current finances. The idea is that you are in a mental box that has locked you up in that income level. When you step out of that box, you will be surprised at how fast things change.\\n\\nThe amount of money you earn in a year is not the amount of money you are capable of earning. Instead, it is the amount of money you know how to earn in a year. The big idea about earning much more than you currently do is seeing what else is possible that you have not paid attention to.\\n\\nIf there is any new thing you need, it is to learn to become. The knowledge and skillset you already have are likely enough to multiply your income. But you need to open up your world. Someone knows something you don't. And that piece of information will make your income surge.\\n\\nWe all live in a mental box. And how much you earn is according to the possibilities in your mental box. You can grow your income incrementally by staying in your mental box but if you want to multiply your income, you need to step out of that mental box. And taking that step is hard.\\n\\nThe eventual decision you will make to step out may not be that hard. But coming to terms with that decision may be very hard. There are beliefs you hold dear that won't make it easy for you.\\n\\nFor example, the decision for you can be relocating to another country. But you are too comfortable and emotionally attached to the country you are. Maybe you have pictures and videos of the other country. You even talk to your friends about how amazing the place is. But you can't just get yourself to get the visa and book the flight.\\n\\nAnd the “what-ifs” keep abounding each time you think about it:\\n\\nWhat if I run out of money — I’ll have no friends to run to\\n\\nWhat if I don’t like the food?\\n\\nWhat if they don’t have ketchup?\\n\\nWhat if their economy collapses?\\n\\nWhat if my home country announces a travel ban?\\n\\nWhat if my kids don’t like it?\\n\\nWhat if the schools are not as good?\\n\\nWe come up with every reason to stay in our comfort zone. This happens to everybody. Nobody is exempted. The income we desire is always outside our mental box. And the moment we make that very uncomfortable leap to step out everything changes. But before we see the changes in the bank account, we notice it first on our bodies. There is always a (seemingly unrelated) physiological reaction.\\n\\nIt can be so bad that you actually fall sick. Bob Proctor always talks about when he wanted to quit his job at the fire department to launch out on his own, he literally fell sick. For some, their whole body would shake by just the thought of the decision. For some, it could be something relating to the loss of appetite. Or a meal you love suddenly becomes tasteless. These kinds of things happen when you try to step out of your mental box.\\n\\nNow, this doesn't mean that when you react like that you are about to step out of your mental box. Many other things can be responsible for that reaction. But when it is tied to a decision that takes you where you have not gone before, this is often the case. A very common reaction is headache plus stomachache at the same time.\\n\\nIt is somewhat similar in principle to pregnancy. Where you are about to birth something new, you feel like your life is threatened.\\n\\nIn a lot of cases, people run back to safety and comfort. When they hit the wall of their mental box and feel their physiological reaction, they go back to doing what they know. Even when the risk is logical, their emotions still won't let them go.\\n\\nBut that is where the multiplier effect is. There is incremental income growth in your mental box. But you have to step out to have it multiplied.\\n\\nHow do you make stepping out easier? That is a discussion for another day. For today, know that the fastest way to multiplying your income is to break out of your mental box. Don’t go back to safety. Break out of that limitation.\\n\\nCheers.\",\n",

              "   \"Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual or entity receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company.\\n\\nThe company pools clients’ risks to make payments more affordable for the insured.\\n\\nInsurance policies are used to hedge against the risk of financial losses, big and small, that may result from damage to the insured or her property or liability for damage or injury caused to a third party.\\n\\nUnderstanding How Insurance Works\\n\\nThere is a multitude of different types of insurance policies available, and virtually any individual or business can find an insurance company willing to insure them-for a price. The most common types of personal insurance policies are auto, health, homeowners, and life.\\n\\nMost individuals in the United States have at least one of these types of insurance, and car insurance is required by law.\\n\\nBusinesses require special types of insurance policies that insure against specific types of risks faced by a particular business.\\n\\nFor example, a fast-food restaurant needs a policy that covers damage or injury that occurs as a result of cooking with a deep fryer.\\n\\nAn auto dealer is not subject to this type of risk but does require coverage for damage or injury that could occur during test drives.\\n\\nInsurance policies available for very specific needs, such as :\\n\\nkidnap and ransom (K&R)\\n\\nMedical malpractice\\n\\nProfessional liability insurance, also known as errors and omissions insurance.\\n\\nInsurance Policy Components\\n\\nWhen choosing a policy, it is important to understand how insurance works.\\n\\n[ Important: Three crucial components of insurance policies are the premium, policy limit, and deductible.]\\n\\nYou should definately have a firm understanding of these concepts goes a long way in helping you choose the policy that best suits your needs.\\n\\nPremium\\n\\nA policy’s premium is its price, typically expressed as a monthly cost.\\n\\nThe premium is determined by the insurer based on your or your business’s risk profile, which may include creditworthiness.\\n\\nFor example, if you own several expensive automobiles and have a history of reckless driving, you will likely pay more for an auto policy than someone with a single mid-range sedan and a perfect driving record.\\n\\nDifferent insurers may charge different premiums for similar policies. So finding the price that is right for you requires some legwork.\\n\\nPolicy Limit\\n\\nThe policy limit is the maximum amount an insurer will pay under a policy for a covered loss.\\n\\nThese Maximums may be set:\\n\\n1- per period (annual or policy term),\\n\\n2- per loss or injury,\\n\\n3- over the life of the policy, AKA the lifetime maximum.\\n\\nTypically, higher limits carry higher premiums.\\n\\nFor a general life insurance policy, the maximum amount the insurer will pay is referred to as the face value.\\n\\nIt's the amount paid to a beneficiary upon the death of the insured.\\n\\nDeductible\\n\\nThe deductible is a specific amount the policy-holder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurer pays a claim. Deductibles serve as deterrents to large volumes of small and insignificant claims. Deductibles can apply per-policy or per-claim depending on the insurer and the type of policy. Policies with very high deductibles are typically less expensive because the high out-of-pocket expense generally results in fewer small claims.\\n\\nSpecial Considerations\\n\\nConcerning health insurance, people who have chronic health issues or need regular medical attention should look for policies with lower deductibles.\\n\\nThough the annual premium is higher than a comparable policy with a higher deductible, less expensive access to medical care throughout the year may be worth the trade-off.\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nInsurance is a contract (policy) in which an insurer indemnifies another against losses from specific contingencies and/or perils.\\n\\nThere many types of insurance policies. Life, health, homeowners, and auto are the most common forms of insurance.\\n\\nThe components that make up most insurance policies are the deductible, policy limit, and premium.\",\n",

              "   'With pensions reserved mostly for government workers and a select few private-sector employees, self-funded retirement funds are a key part of your prime working years. That said, it’s no surprise the 401(k) has become the dominant force in retirement funds since its almost accidental creation in 1978. And with Social Security’s uncertain future, we can expect it to remain a popular choice going forward.\\n\\nToday, workers dreaming of retirement often watch their 401(k) savings account balances like hawks. But why watch them if you don’t know where you stand?\\n\\nComparing your 401(k) balance to those in your age range shows you how well you’re doing. Additionally, you’ll also want to understand how much savings you need at each stage to retire comfortably when the time comes — and how to get there.\\n\\nWe’ll examine all that and more to help you in your retirement planning.\\n\\nOverall Average 401(k) Balance\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter in 2019, Fidelity Investments, a leader in American workplace benefits, reported its average 401(k) balance sat at $105,200. This was a slight decrease of less than 1% compared to the previous quarter, which hit a record high of $106,000.\\n\\nFidelity Investments stated the decrease was due to fluctuations in the stock market and that despite these fluctuations, it continued to “see positive investing and savings behaviors among people saving in Fidelity retirement plans.”\\n\\nWhile the average balance is a good starting point for seeing where you stand, it can be more helpful to take a look at average 401(k) balances for those in your age or generation bracket. Often, these will be people who’ve been in the workforce and investing for a similar length of time.\\n\\nAverage 401(k) Balance by Generation and Participation Duration\\n\\nMost financial advisors will tell you retirement planning is a marathon, not a sprint, so it’s vital to get into it early and stick with it for the long haul. Fidelity’s average 401(k) balance analysis backs up this stance.\\n\\nMillennials who’ve invested for a decade have an average 401(k) balance of $137,300, which is 30.5% more than the $105,200 average. This number continues climbing as you move into older generations, as Generation X and baby boomers’ retirement savings land at $281,000 and $366,100, respectively.\\n\\nAdding just another five years to that number results in even more significant gains. Millennial savers who’ve invested for 15 years have an extra 31.4% in their 401(k) retirement accounts, putting them at $180,400.\\n\\nGeneration X savers who’ve been investing in their 401(k) accounts for 15 years have an average balance of $359,200, which is 27.8% more than 10-year investors.\\n\\nFinally, baby boomers who’ve participated in a 401(k) for a decade and a half have an average balance of $438,300. That’s 19.7% more than 10-year participants.\\n\\nHere’s a quick glance at the numbers:\\n\\nThose with 10 years of 401(k) participation\\n\\nMillennials: $137,300\\n\\nGeneration X: $281,000\\n\\nBaby boomers: $366,100\\n\\nThose with 15 years of 401(k) participation\\n\\nMillennials: $180,400\\n\\nGeneration X: $359,200\\n\\nBaby boomers: $438,300\\n\\nThe moral of this numerical story is to get into your 401(k) early and stick with it to complete that retirement marathon.\\n\\nAverage 401(k) Balance by Age\\n\\nThe folks at CNBC spoke further with Fidelity about its average 401(k) balances and how they broke down. This brought in more specific numbers showing the average American retirement account balances by age ranges.\\n\\nHere’s how each age range looks:\\n\\n20–29 years old: $11,800\\n\\n30–39 years old: $42,400\\n\\n40–49 years old: $102,700\\n\\n50–59 years old: $174,100\\n\\n60–69 years old: $195,500\\n\\nDespite the average 401(k) balances in the U.S. setting records in the past few quarters, the average balances by age are still not where they need to be. Fidelity and other experts recommend having at least 10 times your yearly salary saved by 67 years old, the retirement age for full Social Security benefits. With the average 401(k) balance of workers in their 60s landing at $195,500, it’s unlikely most people are meeting this goal.\\n\\nIf you’re a little behind in your retirement savings, you’re not alone. Instead of panicking, look at where you stand now and where you need to be at upcoming milestones, then adjust your savings to meet these key points.\\n\\n30: one times your annual salary\\n\\n35: two times your annual salary\\n\\n40: three times your annual salary\\n\\n45: four times your annual salary\\n\\n50: six times your annual salary\\n\\n55: seven times your annual salary\\n\\n60: eight times your annual salary\\n\\n67: 10 times your annual salary\\n\\nBoost Your 401(k) Savings by Reducing Debt\\n\\nIf your 401(k) savings aren’t where you want them to be, but you’re also dealing with debt, focus first on paying down your debt.\\n\\nOnce you finish paying off debts, you can funnel the cash formerly reserved for the minimum payment into your monthly 401(k) contributions. Essentially, you’ll be living on the same amount as when you were paying off debt, but instead of that extra money going toward your outstanding debts and interest charges, it will help fill out your 401(k).\\n\\nYou’d be surprised how much even the smallest amount can impact your final 401(k) balance when it’s time to retire. For example, if you roll just $50 monthly into your 401(k) contributions, you could have an extra $86,866 at retirement. This assumes you’re 25 years old, plan to retire at 66 and earn a modest 4% investment return.\\n\\nThe flexibility to put your money where you want — like saving for retirement — is one of the big reasons being debt-free makes a smart financial goal.\\n\\nMethods to Reduce Your Debt and Increase Your 401(k) Balance\\n\\nReady to tackle your debt? Great! There are a few tried-and-true debt-payoff methods that can help you reach your goals quickly and easily.\\n\\nDebt Avalanche\\n\\nThe debt avalanche method lets you focus on debts with the highest interest rates and balances first. Once you pay off one debt, you roll its total payment down to the debt with the next highest interest rate and balance.\\n\\nThis debt-repayment method is an excellent option because it saves you the most on interest over time. It also allows you to split the payment from each paid-off debt between the next debt and your 401(k) contributions.\\n\\nThe biggest downside to this method is it sometimes takes a long time to pay off your first few debts, making it difficult to build up a sense of momentum.\\n\\nDebt Snowball\\n\\nIf you’re looking for some instant gratification with paying off debt, the debt snowball method may be for you. When using this debt-payoff approach, you roll all your spare cash to the debt with the lowest balance while continuing to pay the minimum payments on all other debts.\\n\\nOnce you pay off the debt with the lowest balance, you roll that payment on top of the debt with the next highest balance. You continue this process until all your debts are paid off.\\n\\nThe debt snowball method often motivates people because you can watch debt balances quickly plummet to zero. If you want to double up the satisfaction, you can move only half of the previous debt’s payment into the next debt and roll the other half into your 401(k) contribution rate. For example, if you were paying $100 per month on your first debt, you could roll $50 per month into your next debt and $50 per month into your 401(k) contributions.\\n\\nRolling half of these payments into your 401(k) contribution rate becomes even more beneficial if you have not yet hit the cap on your employer match. Using the above example, if your employer’s matching contribution is 50%, that $50 per month jumps to $75.\\n\\nOn the downside, since you’re focusing on the lowest balance, this can leave high-interest, high-balance debts sitting and racking up interest charges.\\n\\nDebt Consolidation\\n\\nDebt consolidation takes most or all your credit cards and other debts and rolls them into a single loan with a lower interest rate. Not only does the lower interest rate generally result in a lower monthly payment, but rolling multiple credit cards into one loan also gives you a lower payment due to credit card companies’ minimum-payment rules.\\n\\nA debt consolidation loan takes all those minimum payments you’re making and puts them into one easy-to-manage payment. It may also result in a quick boost to your credit score , as credit bureaus often see their fixed terms as more manageable than revolving credit card debt. Debt consolidation also allows you to immediately roll your monthly savings into your 401(k) contribution rate, or you can use the savings to pay off the consolidation loan quicker and save on interest.\\n\\nThe only big drawback to a consolidation loan is that you must have a satisfactory credit score, and high credit card balances can prevent you from getting approved.\\n\\nNow Keep That Retirement Savings Growing\\n\\nWith the average 401(k) balances in hand, the key now is to get to work building that balance and sustaining it. Remember, this is a career-long marathon and not a quick sprint to the finish line, so remain diligent and continuously increase your contributions whenever you can.\\n\\nRemember, if you crush it and find you’ve reached the yearly contribution limit for a 401(k) — which is $19,500 in 2020 (plus $6,500 in catch-up contributions if you’re over 50) — you can also enroll in other retirement plans, like a traditional or Roth IRA. Or you might put some money into the stock market or other investment vehicles to further pad your retirement savings balance.\\n\\nThis article was written by Justin Cupler, a contributing writer at Tally.

              "   'Photo by Paul Green\\n\\nWe have arrived at that time of year when we all start to reevaluate our finances . Perhaps you are already feeling the impact of your Christmas spending, and you want to set financial resolutions for the new year to alleviate the cost of your holiday festivities.\\n\\nWhatever 2020 has in store for you, you could likely benefit from getting on top of your spending once and for all, especially post-Christmas. Whether you’re saving to buy a new home or are tired of living paycheck to paycheck, a New Year’s resolution may be just what you need to jumpstart your financial goals.\\n\\nWithout any guidance or experience, you may be unsure of what your first steps should look like. Maybe the mere thought of enforcing any type of financial order gives you a migraine. You wouldn’t be alone in your pain, but there is hope for relief; the best time to start is now.\\n\\nAdmittedly, financial resolutions cannot be set on a whim on New Year’s Eve and promise success. Instead, prior education and proper planning are essential to improve your chances of sticking to your goal. Taking this step now will put you on the fast track toward financial freedom. First, you must acknowledge your current situation, identify the mistakes you’re making, and learn the best financial goals you can set to overcome them.\\n\\nSigns You’re Spending Too Much\\n\\nWhile some of us are aware that our finances need attention, many of us are guilty of turning a blind eye to our bad habits. Excessive spending in small amounts may seem harmless, but it adds up in a big way over time, creating serious budget damage .\\n\\nThe good news is that there are some tell-tale signs you’re spending too much or failing to manage your finances successfully. They include:\\n\\nAlways running out of money on or before the end of the month\\n\\nStruggling to develop a savings fund\\n\\nContinually using your credit card to bail you out\\n\\nNever quite being sure where your money went\\n\\nNever checking your receipts\\n\\nHaving very little spare cash after rent, mortgage, and bill withdrawal\\n\\nIf you identify with any of these warning signs, you may be on the path to financial disaster. Although this is a common way to live for teenagers and young adults, it is not smart or sustainable. If you have a family in tow, overspending like this every month can be even more detrimental by affecting your children.\\n\\nFigure Out Where Your Money Goes\\n\\nThe first step to overcoming these problems is determining where your money is going right now. This will help you identify “spending leaks” and expenses that you can do without. You’ll also gain a better understanding of how you can approach financial goals that work for you. But how exactly do you figure out where you are spending all your money?\\n\\nIn truth, there is no quick solution. If you want to know where your money goes, it will take some time and effort. You will have to track and record your spending for the next month. Consider using a spreadsheet or tracking app for this task to simplify the process.\\n\\nOnce you have tracked your total spending, deduct your necessary monthly expenses, such as rent, utilities, and insurance. Then, sit down and weed through the spending that is not essential to living. Consider how much you spend on purchases like takeout or digital subscriptions. For each “spending leak,” ask yourself the following questions:\\n\\nCan I afford this?\\n\\nDo I need it?\\n\\nHow much does it cost me across the year?\\n\\nIs there a cheaper alternative?\\n\\nCould I cut down on spending in this area?\\n\\nWhat is my current net worth? (e.g. how much do I own vs how much do I owe?)\\n\\nOnce you’ve answered these questions, it should be clear what you are wasting money on and where you could potentially implement financial goals in your 2020 resolutions. Don’t underestimate how helpful this step can be toward mastering your overall budget. You can only free yourself of financial restraints when you realize what’s binding you. Remember that this doesn’t mean you must abandon every nonessential purchase; however, you must consider its value to you in comparison to your goals.\\n\\nThe Benefits of Finally Dominating Your Finances\\n\\nWe know what you’re thinking; all of this seems like hard work. Why bother? Sure, your budget isn’t where you’d like it to be, but do you really need to go above and beyond to get things back in order? The simple answer to this question is yes. Finding a successful method for managing your finances will reap life-changing benefits, including the following:\\n\\nA savings pot you can rely on\\n\\nA budget that lasts all month long\\n\\nLess financial stress\\n\\nA more opulent lifestyle (yes, really!)\\n\\nBetter financial coping strategies\\n\\nMore money altogether\\n\\nDon’t hold yourself back from integrating those benefits into your own reality. Here are some of the most popular financial resolutions and what exactly they could do for you in 2020.\\n\\nSet The Best Financial Goals in 2020\\n\\nThere’s no big secret to setting financial goals in your household. In reality, you just need to sit down and put in the work. However, identifying a particular focus for your 2020 resolutions will improve your chances of success. The list below explores a variety of popular financial goals that will help you narrow down your own efforts.\\n\\nCreate a Budget\\n\\nDespite the fact that 93% of people feel budgeting is necessary, it remains a fundamental step that 33% of the American population fails to take. If you’re new to the pursuit of financial independence, you might be part of that percentage.One of the main reasons why people don’t take control of their finances is that they aren’t properly educated and don’t know where to start. If you are following the steps listed in this article, you already made some progress when you began tracking and recording your expenses. You still have some work left to do if you want budgeting to be a successful 2020 resolution; however, it isn’t the colossal undertaking it may appear to be. Below is an action plan for starting the creation of your budget:\\n\\nCalculate expenses (which you’ve already done)\\n\\nGain a clear idea of your income\\n\\nSet financial goals (debt payoff, savings plans, etc.)\\n\\nTake the time to track/record spending\\n\\nRemain realistic about occasional overspending, but always return to your budget\\n\\nWant to learn more about creating a budget?\\n\\nOnce you sit down intentionally to tackle this, you should find that a decent budget doesn’t take any longer than an hour or two to write up. Whether you keep it on your fridge or saved in a computer file, this will represent a huge stepping stone toward your financial freedom.\\n\\nNote, too, that no budget is completely uncompromising. Your financial goals should be reevaluated and modified as your income and lifestyle change. There is no need to panic when events don’t go according to plan. Simply use your current budget as a template to update your goals and find solutions.\\n\\nDo Away With Debt\\n\\nIf debt is a prominent expense in your overall budget plan, the next goal you may consider is how to get rid of it. The road to financial freedom is long and strenuous with unpaid debt hanging over your head, so it’s an issue you will want to address sooner rather than later. Once you make a big enough dent in your debt, you will have extra money leftover each month to put toward savings or luxuries.\\n\\nThe best way to tackle this goal head-on is by establishing some sort of debt payoff plan. We are not referring to the payment plan your debt agency or bank already has in place. Instead, you will want to implement a plan that involves getting rid of your debt in the shortest time possible. Most millennials with debt feel more confident about paying it off over the next five years .\\n\\nThat time frame will depend heavily on your personal circumstances, including your income, budget, and how much debt you have accumulated. Overstretching yourself to clear out all of your debt in a few months will likely leave you in financial turmoil. Instead, you need to develop a repayment plan that fits comfortably within your own budget while accommodating your personal goals.\\n\\nIn order to specify the parameters of your debt-alleviating resolution, first decide how much debt you would like to pay over the coming year. Then, you can quickly determine how much you will need to pay each month to make that happen. Adjust the plan accordingly until you settle on monthly amounts that work for you.\\n\\nIf you have multiple debts right now, a management plan like this can be tricky to follow. In that instance, consider consolidating the debts you have so that you only need to worry about one monthly, manageable expense.\\n\\nWant some printables to help you pay off debt?\\n\\nFund in Case of Emergency\\n\\nOnce you have settled on a budget and started tackling your debt, you should finally be in the position where setting some money aside is possible. Savings are fundamental to life’s ups and downs; otherwise, you’ll be up the creek without a paddle when your boiler breaks or your child comes home with a permission form (and price tag) for a costly school trip.\\n\\nFailure to keep an emergency fund is often what leads us into debt in the first place. After all, emergencies are not something for which we can plan.\\n\\nWhile experts suggest that your emergency fund should be enough for around three to six months of living, there’s no “right” number when it comes to setting money aside. If you are in the process of paying off debt, a safe and manageable amount to strive for is $1,000.\\n\\nSetting any amount of money aside is progress. In addition to giving you a slight financial cushion, even small payments here each month help you adjust to the all-important saving habit. It is developing habits like this that will be the driving force for your journey toward financial freedom.\\n\\nMuch like with your debt management plan, you can start saving by determining a few factors as follows:\\n\\nHow much you want to save overall\\n\\nThe amount you need to set aside each month\\n\\nThe incentives you can set to help yourself reach your goals\\n\\nThen, all that is left to do is to start saving. After you reach your initial 2020 resolution, you may be able to increase your emergency fund goal to account for bigger financial mishaps like job loss.\\n\\nRemember Your Retirement\\n\\nIt’s easy to forget about our financial futures when we’re so focused on our current situations and troubles. Sadly, that failure to consider the future can leave us without money when we need it the most. Elderly living often comes with added healthcare costs and a whole lot more free time to fill. That’s why now is the time to save for your retirement.\\n\\nWhen you don’t have heaps of excess money to spend, this may seem like a frivolous expense that you could do without. You are already saving for emergencies, after all, so why bother with retirement, too? Perhaps the best way to overcome this perspective is to remember that your pension is an investment.\\n\\nIf your employer makes contributions, your money is growing with no additional effort. We would argue that doing away with your unnecessary subscriptions is well worth a better and more stable future. Though, with a proper budget, you should be able to manage this goal without compromising too much.\\n\\nIf you’re currently dealing with debt or other financial obligations, you may find it difficult to still contribute to your retirement accounts. We suggest continuing to contribute if your employer offers a match though. It’s an instant return on your investments. Quite literally free money that your employer gives you.\\n\\nNow if you’re strapped for cash then work towards this goal, but make sure you get back to this ASAP. Once you’re debt free — crank up the knob on your retirement contributions as much as possible. Most experts recommend saving 15% of your income , not including employer match. We say save until it hurts, while not sacrificing necessities .\\n\\nTightening your belt a little now will pay off exponentially in the future. Ensuring your retirement savings maintain your living expenses through your lifespan is critical.\\n\\nFocus On A Financial Plan\\n\\nNot to be confused with a budget, a financial plan focuses on where you would like your finances to be rather than where they are now. This can be incredibly useful for setting up a forecast for long-range financial goals such as purchasing a house. After all, laying out that plan in front of you allows you to work backward and see what you need to do with your finances now to make it happen.\\n\\nIn reality, all the points on this list could be considered part of your financial plan. They’re undoubtedly going to make an appearance at some point in your journey. A financial plan should focus on all phases, helping you to keep on track and see the light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\nWhile financial plans are unique to our individual situations , this should be a comprehensive examination of every aspect of your finances now and moving forward. As you draw up your plan, there are many considerations to be made, including the following:\\n\\nLong-term and immediate financial goals\\n\\nCurrent spending and limitations\\n\\nFuture financial predictions\\n\\nSteps you need to take to make your plan happen\\n\\nA rough time frame to provide financial focus\\n\\nLike your budget, your financial plan will probably change often, and that’s okay. Still, you should soon find that having this guideline in place goes a considerable way toward keeping your finances in line. It should ultimately bring your monetary goals within a more comfortable reach.\\n\\nCut Down on Spending\\n\\nThe simple truth is that you can’t save what you spend. While we may like to think that every instance of our spending is absolutely necessary, this purely is not the case. Even those of us who live to the wire often make the mistake of spending money where we don’t need to. Be it takeout or an Amazon Prime subscription, these are costs that can add up a great deal more than we realize. Cutting them in half or even altogether is sometimes the only way to achieve the financial freedom we are after.\\n\\nWe don’t mean that you need to say no to every treat in your life. After all, the journey to financial independence is about living a fulfilling life, not an unhappy one. What good is money if you can’t spoil yourself now and again? The trouble is that, when those treats eat into your ability to save, budget, and clear debts, they become more detrimental than positive. As such, at least consider the ways you can cut excessive costs as a fundamental step.\\n\\nIf you’re a sucker for ordering food, try to limit or budget this habit to a manageable level with your emergency fund, retirement, and other savings taken into account. It may be that you need to order out once a month instead of every week. Equally, if you are subscribed to everything from Netflix to Amazon, consider the platforms you use the most and cancel the subscriptions that you use less frequently. After all, a Netflix subscription that goes unused is going to cost you over $150 a year. That’s money you could be contributing to debt clearance!\\n\\nBy tackling your spending with this mindset, you should find that you can reduce the amount of money you’re paying without totally giving up the luxuries you enjoy. It’s a more reasonable and realistic approach, and it will make managing your finances so much easier than it has ever been before.\\n\\nIncrease Your Income\\n\\nThe idea of earning more to manage finances may seem elusively simple, but it’s surprising how many of us fail to consider this concept when it comes to managing our money. Instead, we want to feel richer without making more. Admittedly, a decent budget plan can help you to achieve that goal, but you can take another route or push your 2020 resolutions to the next level by actually increasing the amount you earn.\\n\\nRemember, it’s not always about how much you earn but it certainly helps. Once you’ve reduced all of your unnecessary expenses, your next best solution is to work on earning more money each month.\\n\\nOf course, this is the real world, and asking for a pay rise doesn’t always pay off (although it might be worth a try.). Even so, there are plenty of ways to earn more money, and they are not as complicated as you think. If you want to increase your income without trying your hand at anything new, why not just take up some overtime? An extra hour each weekday will make more of a difference than you might imagine. What’s more, this effort could help you stand out with management and earn that pay rise after all!\\n\\nLikewise, 44 million Americans now have side hustles, and your income could soon improve if you join them. The best thing about side hustles is that you can embark on them based on your own time and schedule, meaning you can spend as long or as little as you like on these pursuits to give your budget the boost it needs.\\n\\nSome top 2020 side hustles you might want to consider include:\\n\\nBlogging\\n\\nFreelancing\\n\\nBuying and selling\\n\\nSurvey sites (SwagBucks , PointClub, etc.)\\n\\nCrafting\\n\\nOnce you dip your toe into these waters, you will find that side incomes make all the difference in managing your finances. As for managing this extra income, the best course of action may be to dedicate this money specifically to goals like debt clearance or an emergency fund.\\n\\nKeep Tracking Your Finances\\n\\nCongratulations! You have nearly reached your ultimate goal of financial freedom, but there’s just one last step to take, and it involves tracking. As we have touched on in some of the goals already mentioned, finances change all the time, and it can be challenging to keep on top when you are doing everything manually. You may be pleased to hear, then, that there are plenty of tracker tools out there that could make it easier for you to set your budget and financial plan while keeping on top of them throughout the year.\\n\\nWhen you start looking into such tools, chances are that you will come across an option called Personal Capital and this is a program well worth downloading. It is 100% free to get, and it is fantastic for helping you track every aspect of your budget both now and moving into your financial future.\\n\\nWith easy syncing of accounts and the ability to determine your net worth in seconds, Personal Capital can take all the work out of budget setting. It also has the following benefits:\\n\\nCash flow tracking\\n\\nRetirement planning\\n\\nInvestment intelligence\\n\\nAutomated budgeting moving forward\\n\\nThis simple tool and others like it can make sure that you’re always adjusting your financial priorities and focuses according to your lifestyle and needs. Plus, you should find that a program like this holds you accountable to savings plans etc. that you put in place. Never again will it be as easy to overspend or outright ignore your financial goals!\\n\\n2020 Resolution: Say Hello to Financial Freedom\\n\\nAs you can see, financial goals aren’t difficult to set or maintain with a little know-how and focus. With a tracking tool at hand, you won’t even have to worry about reassessing and returning to the drawing board all year long.\\n\\nReally, finding success in managing money comes down to accountability. Ignoring finances might be easy right now, but it will create so much more work for you down the road. Continuing to turn the other cheek will make this battle impossible to win.\\n\\nYou can prevent that from happening by taking action now and getting things in order this month. Identify your spending habits and then arrange a budget and a financial plan now. There will finally be no more struggling your way through January or feeling that after-Christmas monetary sting; your finances will be sprightly and better than ever before!\\n\\nPerhaps the best thing for us to leave you with is a little reminder that financial goals are not a prison sentence . Rather, these are guidelines to help you get things back on track so you can live the life you desire. Don’t get stuck on the fact that you “fail” merely because you momentarily lose sight of your budget. That mentality will only lead to throwing in the towel. Instead, play the long game . You will probably trip up at some stage, but it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you get back on that financial horse and ride your way to freedom!',\n",

              "   'Tips on How to Talk About Money with your Children\\n\\nChildren are very interesting people especially if you have to talk about “uninteresting” topics with them. They can easily lose focus. First of all, you need to keep them engaged and interested in the conversation. Also, you want them to actively participate and give you their views on the topic.\\n\\nMoney as a topic is broad and can come out as boring. But again, it’s a useful subject if mastered well. In future, it can mean the difference between wealth and poverty. Money and investment can be a sensitive subject, since some parents also don’t like to talk about it and therefore should be handled well.\\n\\nThis article will dig deeper on what money topics to discuss with your children.\\n\\nHere we go….\\n\\nGive Up Control.\\n\\nWe all learn by doing and making mistakes in the process. Let your children handle their own money. Allow them to spend it how they deem best. You can even open a savings account for them and let them manage it, with your help. Allow them to handle withdrawals and deposits. Talk to them regarding their spending, offer them advice on saving and leave the rest of the work to them. After all, guided experience is a safer version of learning. Learn more about this form of learning here.\\n\\nSavings\\n\\nYou can start by asking your children if they have saved any money for themselves. Do they use all their pocket money in school? Some parents are known to give some small money to the children to gauge their spending habits. Find out if they spend it all or they have some kept somewhere. Depending on the age, some teens can do grocery shopping for home. Test them sometimes, instead of a credit card, use cash and see if they save the balance. This way a parent is able to tell if they know anything about saving and their importance.\\n\\nEarning Money\\n\\nPhoto by Jason Rosewell on Unsplash\\n\\nAs children, there are some activities they can participate in to earn money. Communal activities such as cleaning, craft making, and participating in story telling during functions. Also participating in sports activities, making paintings for sale and helping out in elderly homes, among others. All these activities are fun and earn them money. So they can learn to make money, which they can save to do other fun activities later. Teach them that after accumulating enough money, then they get to enjoy other fun activities like traveling, throwing parties for friends and others.\\n\\nHelping the Needy\\n\\nLet your children know that money and possessions are not for them alone. Let them know that money can also be used to help other people that are needy or less privileged. For example,\\n\\nthey can use their money to buy food for homeless people, buy diapers and formula for babies in orphanages and even donating school supplies to needy children. It is important to learn that when one has money, it is not only for personal reasons but also to help others that are in need.\\n\\nTeach by Example\\n\\nPhoto by Marie-Michèle Bouchard on Unsplash\\n\\nOnce in a while go shopping with your children. Let them see how you spend your money on shopping. Also, let them know the difference between ‘needs’ and ‘wants’. Teach them that one cannot do without ‘needs’ while wants can be postponed until one can afford them. Examples of ‘needs’ include, food, water, shelter and education among others while wants can range from toys and extra shoes to perfumes. Show them that much as you might want to buy most things, you can’t afford them all. One has to spend within their means if they have to save money.\\n\\nFinal Remarks\\n\\nLet your children learn to handle money as early as possible. It is important to learn money management skills which will make them successful and financially responsible adults. If they can master money saving concepts at an early age, then as a parent you can only sit back and ‘enjoy the fruits of your labor’ as they turn into financially independent adults.',\n",

              "   'It’s Not Crypto They Don’t Understand, It’s Fiat\\n\\nSomething that I’ve increasingly noticed is that the common misunderstanding around cryptocurrency isn’t so much the blockchain as much as it is that people don’t fully understand fiat currency and how it works.\\n\\nWhen we look at a commodity like gold, we can understand that its value comes from the fact that people want it, it’s hard to acquire, it’s not easy to counterfeit, there aren’t many counterfeits, it would be valued generally the same no matter where you go, it doesn’t matter who produced it, there are accounting processes to track how much gold there is (including several blockchain technologies), there is a limited amount of it, and because of all these things its value typically trends upwards.\\n\\nWhen we look at fiat currency like the US dollar, we can recognize that its value used to come from gold, but now that is has been off the gold standard for so long constantly inflating it only fulfills 1 of the 9 features we previously mentioned. People do want the US dollar, but not everyone because of the other features it doesn’t fulfill. It’s significantly easier to acquire than gold, it cannot be used everywhere, it isn’t valued the same everywhere, if it wasn’t produced by an authority in the United States then it’s counterfeit, it’s significantly easier to counterfeit, there are a lot of counterfeit money, there’s no solid methodology for accounting and tracking existing money, there, there’s no limit to how much US dollars can be printed, and because of all of these things and inflation, it trends downwards.\\n\\nMany people fail to recognize this so when someone points out that Bitcoin fulfills all the things above that gold does as well as improves upon them, they do not see the value in it. For example, people want Bitcoin, it’s extremely challenging to acquire and only becomes more challenging over time, it can be used anywhere and is borderless, it’s valued the same anywhere, anyone can produce it and it will be accepted, there is no way to produce counterfeits, there are no counterfeits, it has the most advanced ledger to track transactions, ownership, and verification, there will only ever be 21,000,000 Bitcoin, we can exactly how many exist at any given point in time, and because of Bitcoin halvings and hardcoded inflation decreases over time, it generally trends upwards.\\n\\nSo, with all this being said, I present the following argument that it’s not that Bitcoin is so hard to understand, it’s more so that the average person didn’t fully grasp the concept of fiat currency, inflation, and how it all ties together. Not to mention that the Federal Reserve is a private company and it’s not even the US government printing the money. The point is that for people to better understand cryptocurrency, they must first truly learn about traditional fiat currency. Too many people are ignorant of these concepts to that point that I expect that many people would see this and might think it was conspiratorial when it’s all public knowledge that is easily accessible to anyone at any time. We’ve brainwashed ourselves into having faith in sovereign currencies which if anything the only promise they have is that they will hopefully lose value at a slow rate while we pretend and behave opposite to that fact.\\n\\nHow many people do you know who think saving with X% interest in a country with an inflation rate higher than that rate are saving and acquiring more wealth? They have more wealth representation in the form of money, but the wealth itself has lost value and the prices of everything else are higher.\\n\\nDo you know someone like this? Is it you?

              "   'Sometimes the only way to get yourself to do something that you know is good for you, is to psychologically trick yourself into doing it.\\n\\nWhy is this? Because our brains have been shaped over millions of years to repeatedly do the things that give us instant gratification even though those things aren’t always to best for us or healthy.\\n\\nSo here are some mind tricks to get past your psychological urge to spend, spend, spend.\\n\\n#1. Use Automatic Deductions\\n\\nI learned this one while reading The Richest Man In Babylon, whenever you get paid or some extra money turns up in your life, save a chunk of it.\\n\\nI like to save 70% of what I earn but you don’t need to be that hardcore about it, I find that 20% is doable for most people.\\n\\nIf you can use an app or tell the place where you work to automatically deduct 20% of your money and put it into a separate account, the money will start piling up without you even missing that cash.\\n\\nAlmost anyone can get by comfortably on 80% of what they make because a lot of people just blow their extra money on frivolous things. You don’t need to go out to eat every day and you don’t need a new shirt this week. Shaving a bit of your money off to invest it into your future also has the great side effect of making you think twice about your spending habits.\\n\\nIn due time, you will have money to invest and earn money for you over time or you can use it for an emergency fund in case times get tough.\\n\\n#2. Convert The Price Of Things Into Hours Worked\\n\\nThe way I think of a normal job, is that you are trading your time for money, so following that logic; If you get paid 12 dollars an hour, how much is a 40 dollar shirt costing you?\\n\\nThe answer is your trading just under 40 hours of your life for a shirt that isn’t even going to look good in a few months.\\n\\nConverting the price of things into hours worked really opens your eyes to how much people are wasting their time on this earth, people making 8 bucks an hour are blowing their money on 30 dollar meals, I don’t even want to do that math on that one, it just sounds painful.\\n\\nP. S. Instead of letting this idea cause you existential dread, use this knowledge to get out of the trading hours for a set amount of money and start your own business, yeah you don’t make money right away so it will feel like you are trading hours for nothing, but you will eventually make enough money that it will all have been worth it and you’ll think why doesn’t everybody do this?\\n\\n#3. Create Extra Spare Change To Save\\n\\nWhat does this even mean? There is an app called Acorns that makes it super easy for you to save and invest money.\\n\\nIt works by rounding up whatever charge you have to the nearest dollar, so if you buy something that is $5.50, Acorns will round that charge up to $6.00 but it will save the extra 50 cents, so every time you spending with your card, you are also saving.\\n\\nthis extra money gets deposited and invested so eventually your spare change is not only being saved up but is making money for you as well.\\n\\nAgain like the first method of automatic deductions, the money getting saved won’t be missed, after all when we buy something with cash we get change too but it isn’t being invested like it would with Acorns, it just sits there in your piggy bank or ashtray.\\n\\nIn Conclusion\\n\\nThere are many clever ways to trick yourself into saving money, you just need to actually implement them into your life, I’ve chosen the easiest ones I could find and if you use them, a positive change is going to come out of it.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nHow To Successfully Save Money Even On A Tight Budget\\n\\nThe 7 Bad Habits Every Poor Person Has\\n\\n6 Money Mistakes To Avoid In Your 20s',\n",

              "   'Maximizing Your Money When Buying Precious Metals, photo courtesy of Metals.com\\n\\nAny informed buyer of gold and silver will tell you that buying precious metals bullion at spot price is virtually impossible. While there may be occasions when buying gold and silver at spot is possible, those instances are extremely rare. The spot price of precious metals, and the premium price at which they are sold, affords dealers that sell precious metals to the public to earn revenue by buying at wholesale and selling at retail. It’s akin to going to any department or grocery store; the price at which you might buy a pair of shoes or a box of cereal is not the price the retailer purchased it for. In short, the dealer must make money on the transaction somehow.\\n\\nWith that said, it is possible to stretch your hard-earned money when making precious metals purchases. The key is simply knowing what to buy and when.\\n\\nYour Interests\\n\\nThe first step in deciding what to buy and when is making a decision regarding which precious metals are of most interest to you. Some buyers might be more interested in buying rounds and bars, understanding that these typically have lower premiums over spot. Others might be more interested in coins produced by government mints that feature a face value. These will typically have a higher premium over spot price. Some collectors have more interest in coins rather than rounds and bars. If this is the case, then determining which coins carry the higher premiums (typically the Gold American Eagles and Silver American Eagles carry higher premiums compared to some other coins, such as the Silver Canadian Maple Leaf). Still, others may have greater interest in 90% silver coins, such as the Peace Silver Dollar or the Washington Quarter (with 90% silver composition). Whichever precious metal product garners your interest, getting the most for your money is always the best approach.\\n\\nSpot Price\\n\\nKnowing the spot price goes a long way to ensuring you get the most from your precious metals purchase. Some products, such as coins and rare items, carry a significantly higher premium compared to rounds, bars and other products that are either less scarce or are not in great demand. When knowing the spot price, a buyer can determine whether the amount their paying per ounce is a good deal or a less attractive deal. For example, buying any precious metal in sizes less than an ounce will increase the premium price a great deal. When buying an ounce of gold, the spot price remains the same, but the premium price will be a certain percentage above spot. When buying gold in grams, the spot price is the same while the premium price rises dramatically. Conventional wisdom is that the smaller the item you purchase, the higher over spot price you’ll pay.\\n\\nVolume vs Smaller Quantity\\n\\nWhenever possible, it’s a good idea to buy in larger quantities. Dealers will have reduced premiums for those who purchase 50 gold or silver coins compared to those purchasing just one. It’s understandable that one’s budget will dictate how much someone can spend on precious metals, but keep in mind that buying in volume always means lower premiums.\\n\\nFind the Best Dealer\\n\\nDifferent dealers carry slightly different premiums over similar or identical coins, rounds and bars. Finding a reputable dealer is helpful when stretching your hard-earned cash. That’s why people shop at Metals.com for all their bullion needs. The lower overhead, greater storage flexibility and increase inventory will typically translate into lower premiums from online dealers.\\n\\nNo matter which precious metals items catch your attention, there are ways to get more from your money and to maximize your purchasing power.\\n\\nThe Metals.com Staff',\n",

              "   'If you’re going to make the argument that money = speech, then you should also be okay with “murder for hire.” If someone gives a hit man money, then they’re arguably not plotting someone’s death, they’re just saying “hey I’m just saying it would be nice if this person was dead.” Now to that you could say that this example is different because it involves a direct threat of violence, which crosses the line and is one of the few examples of speech that isn’t protected.\\n\\nTo that I would say that when special interests lobby the government, they’re actively hurting other people. When the military-industrial complex exercises its “free speech” in buying off politicians, they’re effectively saying “hey you should definitely continue to wage war in the Middle East and kill innocent civilians with our fancy technology.” When drug companies and health insurance companies exercise their “free speech,” they’re effectively saying “hey you should let us continue to price gouge people when they buy prescription drugs or health insurance so that they go bankrupt or die because they don’t get the care they need” (as it happens anywhere from 250,000 to 1 million people go bankrupt from medical bills a year, as it’s one of the leading causes of bankruptcies in America). Another example is when big corporations (like General Motors) lobby the government to continue free trade policy that allows them to outsource jobs, causing millions of people in the rust belt to lose their manufacturing jobs and suffer as a result. We can keep going down the list of special interests but I think my point is clear.\\n\\nSo when special interests are exercising their “free speech” in this way, they’re directly hurting millions of people who have no power to push back. The point of free speech is that everyone has equal power to voice their views and speak out on issues to influence public discourse. But treating money as speech disproportionately helps the mega-rich and hurts working class people. Now, to be honest, I don’t know what the best solution is to mitigate this. Some would support publicly funded elections, in which candidates (who cross certain thresholds of polling) are funded by tax dollars. Some might say to just limit the amount of money that people can donate to a very small amount. But the point is that there are so many politicians who are propped up by big money rather than by grassroots support that comes from fighting for the people and pushing popular ideas. So I don’t think we should view money as identical to speech.',\n",

              "   'Just to keep the record straight, gun ownership has actually gone down in America, according to the University of Chicago. Percent of households with guns dropped from 47% to 31% from 1973 to 2014. Percent of individuals with guns also dropped from 28.1% to 22.4% (not as big a drop admittedly but obviously not an increase). This general trend was also reported by the Washington Post.\\n\\nThis has coincided with decreases in gun violence according to PEW Research Center (not necessarily implying causation, but that’s what the data shows). They reported that from 1993 to 2014, the gun homicide rate was cut in half.\\n\\nIt is true that Latin American countries have excessively strict gun laws that are much more authoritarian than I would like. The issue there is that when guns are restricted too much, they become sought after by gangs and cartels (kind of like alcohol in Prohibition) and guns get smuggled (from the US to Mexico, for example). I think we can look to other developed countries as a model for restricting gun usage just enough that people can still have their guns while we stop the crazy people from getting them. I agree that gun reform must be done in a constitutional manner (I’m also skeptical about red flag laws and a national database). I don’t know what the exact solution is, but my point in writing this article was to explain why absolutely nothing is done (finding the right balance is crucial with universal background checks, for example. Yes, in theory, they could be a gateway to confiscation, but there’s plenty of precedent of countries with guns and background checks. It’s not so black and white).\\n\\nSorry if I was unclear with this point, but I didn’t mean for the gambling/prostitution point to be a “gotcha” (I also think those things should be legal) I was just mentioning the implications of the money = speech argument. On that note, you argue that murder-for-hire is different as that’s a direct threat of violence. Well I would say that when the military-industrial complex buys off politicians, they’re effectively saying that “you should definitely commit to more interventions in the Middle East that kill millions of innocent civilians.” When drug/health insurance companies buy off politicians, they effectively say “please let us price gouge people, causing them to go bankrupt or die” (as it happens anywhere between 250,000 to 1 million people go bankrupt from medical bills in America). You also have big corporations lobbying for trade policies that allow outsourcing and thus millions of jobs to be lost, you have Wall Street buying off politicians to deregulate them so that they can mess with working people’s money (and crash the economy like in 2008), and so on.\\n\\nThe point of free speech is to give all people equal power to voice their views. But treating money as speech allows the mega-rich to get what they want at the expense of millions of people. A study from Princeton actually determined that the US is functionally an oligarchy, with policies being 3 times more likely to be enacted with support from the economic elite, often regardless of what middle class support looks like (I suggest you look at the full report, it’s very interesting).\\n\\nAgain, I’m not talking about having Trump regulate what is “acceptable speech.” We should have a system where the best ideas win. As an example, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez defeated Joe Crowley in her 2018 primary even though Crowley outraised her at a ratio of 15 to 1. Regardless of your or my opinion on AOC or Joe Crowley, we can look at that and say that it’s possible to win even when you’re at a disadvantage with money. Now you’re right that we could have someone stop lobbying from some groups, but there is a solution to that — publicly funded elections in which all the money is out of the and you have all the candidates start on an equal footing so that the best ideas win. Admittedly I haven’t read too much about publicly funding elections, and of course that system will have its own problems. But I think it shows that potential to create a system where there are no loopholes for only Trump’s special interests to donate money.\\n\\nHopefully that helps clarify my thoughts.',\n",

There are no coins or notes, no bank branches or bank accounts, and therefore no apps to tell you how much money you have left to spend or invest.\\n\\nIt’s Sunday evening and you’re hungry. You realise you can’t whizz through the drive-through, swipe your card and get a Big Mac meal in exchange — there are no bank cards.\\n\\nBut you’re a smart human and managed to teleport some moolah from your world. You walk into the store and give the owner your money in exchange for a burger and chips. Except, instead of receiving a nice meal, you get a puzzled stare.\\n\\nIt turns out she has no clue what money is — this world only works through the exchange of physical goods. If you want the Big Mac, you’ll have to give her a pair of pink headphones.\\n\\nAt this point, you say, “What! This story is absurd — what world doesn’t have money?! And who will give a pair of headphones in exchange for a Big Mac meal?”\\n\\nIt depends on how hungry you are, right…?\\n\\nLuckily I snap my fingers, you wake up, and you realise this was just an awful dream. You give a big sigh of relief, “Phew, luckily I can have my Bic Mac and supersize it. Woot!”\\n\\nA few hundred years ago, this scenario wouldn’t have been so absurd. If you whipped out a card or a couple of notes to buy something, you would be considered stark raving mad. You may even have been hanged for witchcraft.\\n\\nTrading one product for another was the norm at some point in time. For example, if we lived a couple of 100 years ago and you needed some building material, I could have given you some timber and ropes in exchange for a cow. This way, you would’ve had material to build a shelter, and I would’ve had food for my family.\\n\\nCutting up a cow in exchange for less raw material clearly illustrates the limitations of this form of value exchange.\\n\\nFast forward to today and the primary means of exchange has a slightly different shape. It looks more like this: Notes, coins, debit and credit cards, banks, digital money, apps, insurance, hedge funds, derivatives and futures trading, stock exchanges, interest, tax, retirement annuities, pay-day loans, bonds, and the list goes on and on.\\n\\nMoney has spread to almost every corner of the world with 1000’s of products built around it, impacting every aspect of our lives.\\n\\nIt’s hard to imagine that there used to be a time where the primary means of exchange was as simple as handing someone a cow in exchange for timber and ropes.\\n\\nWhile some say money makes the world go round, others argue it made the world go pear-shaped.\\n\\nMoney has come a long way and made our lives easier and better in ways we cannot even calculate. But money has also become complicated, exclusive, and broken in many ways. It has evolved to become centralised, mostly controlled by governments through central banks with policies and regulations governing it.\\n\\nIn the cryptocurrency world, there’s a big buzz around solving the inefficiencies of money through decentralisation, and we often worship or ridicule cryptos on this single feature. However, even though decentralisation is the foundation of a better financial system, the biggest mistake we can make is thinking that’s all that is required.\\n\\nBut it’s not, and that’s what this post is about: It’s a reminder and exploration of what else is required to make money GREAT.\\n\\nLet’s dive in!\\n\\nConnected products\\n\\nDue to the centralised nature of money, it has also become very siloed, with products that are largely incapable of efficiently talking to each other.\\n\\nFintech players have been putting a lot of effort into solving this problem. These efforts are, however, only changing the marketing or user experience around accessing traditional money; they’re not changing money itself and the impact, therefore, is quite marginal.\\n\\nDistributed ledger technologies, on the other hand, are making products fully programmable, interoperable, and streamlined, creating a completely new paradigm shift in how we think about and work with money.\\n\\nTo make this more tangible, here are three examples of a decentralised application that allows you to set up your own If This Then That rules:\\n\\nIF I have cloud storage available, THEN rent it out AND save the income in my car’s wallet to recharge it.\\n\\nI have cloud storage available, rent it out save the income in my car’s wallet to recharge it. IF someone buys 10 coffees from my shop, THEN automatically fund their wallet with a free one AND send them a reminder to recycle the loyalty card they’ve been using before.\\n\\nsomeone buys 10 coffees from my shop, automatically fund their wallet with a free one send them a reminder to recycle the loyalty card they’ve been using before. IF our employees have worked for 1 year and have a peer review of 4.5, THEN increase their salary by 10% AND move it from daily payments to a stream of payments every second.\\n\\nConnected products move money from being decentralised to empowering people to be in control and manage their own money.\\n\\nMiddlemen\\n\\nThe last example above is not just an interesting idea. It also points out a fundamental flaw of today’s money: it can’t stream like music to your ears does.\\n\\nCentralised money and systems have enabled middlemen to take value away from people, making it slow and expensive to move around.\\n\\nFor money to be great, it will not only have to become decentralised, but business models driven by fees will have to be changed as well.\\n\\nDebt\\n\\nDebt has been the oil of the economic machine, the primary driver for the world to function as it does today. It has enabled businesses to start and become highly successful, created job opportunities, and redistributed wealth that otherwise might not have been possible.\\n\\nA big part of the world we see today was made possible because of debt, and it appears to have been the cause of a lot of good. But debt has also been the cause of a lot of bad — divorces, suicides, prostitution, wars and slavery.\\n\\nNow, I don’t think a new decentralised financial system would eliminate debt or take away the pain that is often associated with it, but money can become a lot more responsible if we understood the relationship between debt and identity.\\n\\nIdentity\\n\\nOne of the reasons you can borrow money from a bank or a friend is that there is a certain amount of trust between you and the lender. That trust gives the lender enough confidence that you will be able to pay back the loan.\\n\\nTrust is a very complex concept, but for simplicity purposes, we could boil it down to the sum of the outcomes of all commitments in past relationships, or, put differently, trust is a track record of promises.\\n\\nTo make this work on a national or global level where there is little or no trust between individuals or entities at all, we needed a system that could keep track of these promises.\\n\\nThe digital identity system came in quite handy here. By combining a centralised identity system with an individual’s track record of money, anyone was now able to see how trustworthy or likely someone is to pay back a loan without having any prior relationship with the person.\\n\\nThe problem with a centralised identity system is that it’s not very scalable, highly inefficient and is quite vulnerable to identity theft. If you’ve ever had to fill in forms at different places with the same information multiple times, you would know what I’m talking about.\\n\\nIf we get it right, a decentralised identity system will allow us to never fill in a form again. Even though this would save the world millions of hours, the bigger problem here is not making forms more efficient, but how to make an identity system inclusive.\\n\\nRight now, 1 billion people don’t even have any form of identity record, let alone a decentralised one. For this new system to be truly epic, we’ll have to figure out how to do this on a global scale, making it inclusive to everyone, both the 1 billion without an identity and the 6 billion with a centralised one.\\n\\nThe village effect\\n\\nThere’s an old proverb that says it takes a village to raise a child. It’s simple but also profound in so many ways — it refers to how people learn most effectively, the effect groups of people have on an individual and the ability for the brain to change.\\n\\nWe’re on the cusp of a significant revolution, and our world will never be the same again. Just the mere thought of having money that can stream like music or data breaks my brain. It requires an entirely new paradigm shift to truly grasp how it will impact legacy systems, policies, governments, business models and our relationships with money and machines.\\n\\nBut creating the technology to make this possible, is the easy part. The hardest part is building a new financial system that works on a global level that includes everyone, and this requires a new level of thinking.\\n\\nAlbert Einstein coined it well by saying that the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.\\n\\nSome of the biggest problems we see with money today, things like identity, debt and exorbitant fees were partially created by centralised thinking. What we need to do now is move from centralised thinking to decentralised thinking and then, as we do that, figure out how to do it on a global and inclusive scale.\\n\\nI’ll end off with a quote from Richard Wagner’s article What is wrong with money:\\n\\n“Money doesn’t have value if we keep it in stacks. It has value only in our relationships with others.”\\n\\nMoney is a complicated thing, but I have a slight suspicion that somewhere in these few simple words, we might find a clue to making money great again.',\n",

But somehow the inflation of today is reach 10%, means the Energy drink now priced at $11. To buy 10 pcs of it, you need $110 bucks. It means, your $100 money today can only buy 9 pcs of energy drink.\\n\\nThe equation may not that simple, but you got the point. If your money only sit without working for you, the value will drop over time. But the price of Property is too high, so you can’t afford it right now. What to do?\\n\\nHere Aset Bareng comes. You can own asset together. You put your money on asset that you want, and your ownership will be calculated based on total price of the asset.\\n\\nIf you want to own Property priced at $10,000, and you put your $1000 on this asset then you will own 10 % of this Property. The equation is below.\\n\\n$1000 / $10,000 = 10%\\n\\nWhy ownership is important?\\n\\nIf this Property is rented, and generate passive income then you will get 10% of the income with doing nothing. What if no one rented it?\\n\\nIn most case, the property price growth exceed the inflation rate. So at least, your money is not get eaten by inflation. Later on if you want to sell your ownership of this Property you can still get the same amount of Energy drink compared to first time you put your money in there.\\n\\nStay Safe, Stay Healthy.\\n\\n“Money is just a tool.

              "   'The idea of the state providing the most vulnerable members of society the means to survive is not new. The ancient romans provided the Cura Annonae to their poorest citizens in the form of grain for them to make in to bread, and today the government provides a benefit for those who are sick or unable to find work. For most of human history, people have been needed to create goods and provide services. Making a sports car used to require teams of skilled workers and agriculture still employs around 60% of the world’s population but in the 21st century this is set to change.\\n\\nRapid technological advances in automation and robotics in the near future will leave millions without employment and without other employment options. Low skilled jobs are those that have the greatest risk of being replaced by automation, jobs which normally require no higher education. When these jobs get replaced by machines the skills attained by the people in these roles, which can currently be applied to different low skilled jobs, will become worthless as any financially savvy business owner will use the cheaper option, automation. This puts both the worker, who now has no way to support themselves or their family, and the government, which has to suddenly provide for thousands of new people, in a complicated position. This is why I believe there needs to be a shift from a benefit system only for those who need it to a Universal Basic Income (UBI) system, where every citizen or resident is provided a basic living wage from the government regardless of employment status, health or disability.\\n\\nThe UBI model envisioned would not provide every person enough money to live comfortably. It should, as the benefit does currently, provide enough money to cover basic needs and little more. This means those who are searching for a job, or simply do not want one will have a roof over their head and food on the table, but little more. This eliminates both the anxiety of wondering where the next meal will come from and the requirement for people to work when sick just so they can afford to feed their children all while providing those that wish to pursue alternative endeavours the freedom to do so full time, sans worrying about money.\\n\\nCritics of UBI often argue that providing income to everyone removes the incentive to work and therefore would have negative consequences on productivity and the economy. The current shutdown caused by the global COVID-19 outbreak has disproved this argument on two fronts. The first is that the country is still running while most people, especially those with lower skilled jobs, are sitting at home not working. If UBI was to be implemented tomorrow, and everyone who is currently not working decided not to go back, the country would still function albeit on a very low level. This shows that a small portion of the population can still provide the essential services needed for everyone to survive, and that even if there was a significant drop in employment and productivity the country would still function.\\n\\nThe second rebuttal that the shutdown provides is related to the incentive to work. Critics argue that UBI removes the incentive for people to have a job by removing the financial motivation. This shutdown has shown many people that sitting around in their homes is not as good as it seems while not working. Everyone I know is bored as shit, searching for something to fill the time. Even with basic needs covered, people still need to find something meaningful to do with their day, and working can fill this gap. While UBI will not encourage people to work low skilled jobs, it will encourage them to find something they are passionate about and shift work from a necessity to a rewarding outlet for these passions This covers not only financially, but also physically and mentally as not as much pressure would be on those who have difficulty fulfilling a traditional low-skill worker role. This combined with the elimination of low skilled jobs due to automation will lead to a happier, more productive and more successful society in the long run, instead of the financial and societal ruin predicted by opponents of UBI.\\n\\nAutomation is coming. There is no stopping the inevitable march of technological progress and those who currently have the least job security will be those who suffer the most. UBI has its issues, but it provides a viable alternative to the current system and gives everyone in the country the financial stability to do the things they want to do, rather than the things they have to do to survive. So do the right thing, petition your MP and help look after the bottom line, which lets be real, is you.',\n",

Now onto our regularly-scheduled program.\\n\\nA “pyramid scheme”, as defined by Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute, is “an unsustainable, illegal business model where investment returns are typically from principals [sic] of investments or membership fees instead from the underlying investment gains”. To put it simply, it’s a business model where you’re paid directly from the people who you recruit below you, rather than from a product that you sell or the value of your investment increasing.\\n\\nPyramid schemes have long been banned as an illegal practice in the US and elsewhere around the world, in part due to the losses of entrants stuck at the bottom. Various companies in the United States have been sued for operating as pyramid schemes.\\n\\nThese types of schemes are WAY popular, especially in the United States for a variety of reasons, but chief among them are 1) the desire to make “easy” money and/or 2) gaining financial stability.\\n\\nThe Specter of COVID\\n\\nThe pandemic, along with the response to it on both the national, state, and local levels have wrecked absolute havoc on many’s finances. With many people facing layoffs, possible foreclosure, and defaults on various debts, people have been searching for ways to make money in a weakened job market. Amidst these conditions, these types of schemes and scams have flourished.\\n\\nThe Secret Santa Gift Exchange\\n\\nAround the holidays in 2019, if you were on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram (it’s always social media), you might have seen a friend post about a Secret Santa gift exchange, often tied to sisterhood or female empowerment (or just spreading holiday cheer). It might have looked something like this…\\n\\n“This game isn’t a scam…”, except that it is!\\n\\nIt sounds really innocent, and we are reassured that this isn’t a scam, but no doubt about it, this is a pyramid scheme in its purest form. Some of you might disagree with me, but here are the reasons why.\\n\\nWhy It’s A Pyramid Scheme\\n\\nThe answer lies in this phrase within the post: “You have to buy one gift valued of at [sic] least $10 and send it to your secret santa, you will then receive a few in return (if everyone does it right)”. Of course, what isn’t stated there is that you also must spread this “opportunity” to be able to receive gifts. It’s implied.\\n\\nEssentially, for the price (investment) of one gift, you are promised multiple gifts, which are given directly from the folks that you recruit.\\n\\nCan we see that definition again for a pyramid scheme?\\n\\nPyramid Scheme: a business model where you’re paid directly from the people who you recruit below you, rather than from a product that you sell or the value of your investment increasing.\\n\\nThis Secret Santa gift exchange 100% fits the definition of a pyramid scheme. Even though money is not being exchanged, you are promised a return on investment of over 100%. And of course it’s illegal. The US Postal Inspection Service provides a little more insight here https://www.uspis.gov/news/scam-article/pyramid-schemes.\\n\\nBut Chuku, you ask, what about the Secret Santas at work or with family? Wouldn’t those be pyramid schemes?\\n\\nNOPE!\\n\\nThere are three key differences at play. One, Secret Santas done with friends and family don’t rely on constant recruitment. Two, each person brings one gift and is guaranteed one gift. Three, the number of entries is typically capped by the time of the event.\\n\\nNone of these are true with the Secret Santa gift exchanges being pushed on social media. One, these are typically open to everyone (beginning with one’s social network). Two, you are promised more gifts than what you put in. Three, there is no cap on the number of entrants.\\n\\nSo, when the Holiday’s roll around again and you see these posts…. feel free to ignore (or better yet, report them).\\n\\nPlease let me know your thoughts!',\n",

              "   'Debit Cards Offer No Protection\\n\\nWe trust our debit cards because they’re given to us by our banks, and banks tend to be trustworthy entities, right? Well, if we ignore the issues relating to the 2008 financial crisis, it’s actually the banks that don’t trust us. If you’ve ever tried to refund an item and called up your bank, the chances that they’d be willing to help you are very slim.\\n\\nIf a merchant offers no refund options and you’ve brought an item with a debit card, then you’re out of luck. Your bank won’t give you a refund because there are no policies for that. On the off chance that they do, it’s probably because you’ve threatened to tell the press or write a bad review online.\\n\\nNow, not all banks are equal, and some debit cards are more exclusive and may offer superior payment protection, but they’re usually out of reach for most ordinary people.\\n\\nAnother area in which debit cards fail is with flights. When we travel, all sorts of things can go wrong, from delays to losing baggage. While they’re not frequent occurrences, it’s worth having some payment protection.\\n\\nSo what are the alternatives?\\n\\nWell, there are credit cards and charge cards. Both work slightly differently, with credit cards offering more perks and charge cards being more flexible. By law, every credit card offers some form of payment protection, with more premium cards offering additional protection on top, and these can come in handy for all sorts of purchases.\\n\\nIn one case, I had booked a venue for an event, and the contract said that I’d be entitled to a refund if our group spent above a certain threshold. After the event, the venue didn’t get back to me. They sent vague responses, and months passed before I decided to call up my credit card provider.\\n\\nThe credit card provider immediately refunded my money and launched an investigation. From being vague and not responding to me, the venue immediately followed up and asked me what had happened. I explained the situation, and after looking into the matter, they realised I was right — we had, in fact, exceeded the threshold. I was given an apology, some vouchers, and a full refund.\\n\\nI don’t know how long it would’ve taken had I paid with a debit card, but that single moment made me realise the true value of a good credit card.',\n",

The graph below outlines a chrome performance timeline on a web app that suffers from this.\\n\\n(a) Performance recording of reflows slowing down the application\\n\\nThe purple portion represents rendering which accounts for a large portion of the timeline and if we take a deeper dive at 2100 ms to 3200 ms you’ll see that it is primarily caused by invoking the getBoundingClientRect method on multiple elements.\\n\\n(b) Closer look at “graph a” from ~2100ms to ~3200ms\\n\\nRemoving usage of this method would cause the render time drop significantly (lower is better). As you probably guessed, getBoundingClientRect is not the only one that forces a reflow and a more exhaustive list can be found in the gist link here.\\n\\nSo how do we protect against these reflows? Allow me to introduce a new library called reflow-rejector. It was built using these three principles.\\n\\nMust be in the developers face so that you cannot easily ignore it\\n\\nConfigurable so that you can define your own limits\\n\\nWritten in vanilla JS so that it will work with any JS framework\\n\\nReflow-rejector will maintain a queue of events where an event is defined as usage of any property or method that forces a reflow. That queue will be checked every intervalMs and if the number of events exceeds the maxAllowed then it will notify the developer either through an alert window or just a console error message. Please see the gif below for a better understanding. The demo application reads the offsetLeft property on 20 elements which exceeds the default maxAllowed of 10.\\n\\n(c) Reflow-rejector demo in action\\n\\nA couple of things to note before you add it to your project. It should only be used for development mode since you probably won’t want your customers seeing that alert box. The Element (and other) prototypes will not be overwritten if the library is not initialized. You can also conditionally start and stop the library by using the static initialize and teardown methods.\\n\\nReflow-rejector is open sourced so if you would like to see added functionality feel free to hack at it yourself. There is a small demo web application and unit/integration tests to ensure that your changes won’t cause any regressions. Happy coding and may your application’s reflows be ever in your favor.',\n",

              "   '“Excellence is not an act, but a habit.” (Aristotle)\\n\\nRecognize this? You want to be fitter and more toned, so you set yourself a challenge: “I’ll go to the gym every night after work!” Or: “I’ll run 5k every morning before breakfast!”\\n\\nYou’re super excited: you buy a new running top, the first few days you start really strong… and then…\\n\\nAnd then life happens. You’re tired. You have to work late. That 6am run in the rain doesn’t seem quite so appealing. After a while, your new routine peters out… and you’re back to square one. Maybe to repeat the same process a few months later.\\n\\nI’ve been there. Many times — with working out; with my diet; or with other exciting “life changes”.\\n\\nBut finally, I changed the way I did things. And over the past few years, I’ve run two half-marathons, started a morning routine, drastically reduced the amount of sugar and caffeine I consume, stopped using my phone after 9pm… and many other things that have massively improved my life.\\n\\nHow did I do them? I created habits. And it’s not as hard as you think — if you follow the points below.\\n\\nA 10-step guide to creating habits that stick:\\n\\nStart with one habit at a time. We often try to change our lives in one day. It’s easy to get over-motivated and take on too much, which is one of the main reasons people give up habits. Relax: once the habit is in place, then you can scale up. Stay consistent: go to the gym at the same time on the same day, for example. And don’t miss two days/times in a row — once every now and then won’t ruin your habit (see point 8) — but twice makes it harder to get back into. Make good habits easier and bad habits harder, e.g. hide junk food, and have healthy snacks ready to go and accessible.\\u200b Build a new identity: e.g. “I’m a gym goer… I’m the type of person who enjoys outdoor exercise” (etc). Decide the type of person you want to be, and prove it to yourself with small wins. [Connected to that: associate with role models. Spend more time with people who model the habits you want to mirror.]\\u200b Form a trigger: a ritual you use right before your habit. A study found that people got stronger flossing habits if they flossed after they brushed their teeth — rather than before — because they had a cue which made it easier to remember to floss. After a while the association between flossing and brushing became automatic. Use accountability — team up with someone. For my new morning routine, I texted a friend to tell her when I had done my morning stretches. Knowing she would be waiting to hear from me was the only reason I got up at 6:30am that first day! Start a 30-day challenge — do one habit every day for a month. Often it’s easier to start a time habit (read for 20 minutes a day) than one based on outcome (read 20 pages a day) — you’re more likely to achieve the first. Replace the habit. If you’re giving something up, make sure you’re replacing any needs (e.g. if watching TV gave you a way to relax, find something else to replace that same need). Be imperfect — don’t expect all your attempts to change habits to be successful immediately. Try your best, but expect a few bumps along the way. You will skip your habit from time to time; life crops up. But it doesn’t mean you have to give up.\\n\\nBonus tip:\\n\\nAnalyze why your habit might not be sticking, and what you can do to change that:\\n\\n“When I sat down to analyze why I wasn’t going to the gym, I realized: my closet was in another room. That meant I had to walk out in the cold [to] put on my clothes. It was easier to just stay in bed. Once I realized this, I folded my clothes and shoes the night before. When I woke up the next morning, I would roll over and see my gym clothes sitting on the floor. The result? My gym attendance soared by over 300%.”\\n\\nQuote from Ramit Sethi, personal finance advisor, entrepreneur, and author of “I Will Teach You to Be Rich”.\\n\\nOne final note…\\n\\nDo it for yourself — don’t worry about all the things you “should” have as habits. Choose things that move you towards your goals and that motivate you.\\n\\nAbout the author:\\n\\nHi! I’m Claire — an accountability coach and blogger.

              "   'Google Director Of Engineering: This is how fast the world will change in ten years Michael Simmons Follow Feb 16 · 15 min read\\n\\nIt wasn’t supposed to be like this.\\n\\nFuturists from the 20th century predicted that labor saving devices would make leisure abundant. According to the great economist John Maynard Keynes, the big challenge would be that…\\n\\n“For the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem — how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.” — John Maynard Keynes (1930)\\n\\nFast forward almost a century later.\\n\\nThings didn’t quite go as expected. This quote from a modern researcher captures the current ethos:\\n\\n“Rather than being bored to death, our actual challenge is to avoid anxiety attacks, psychotic breakdowns, heart attacks, and strokes resulting from being accelerated to death.” — Geoffrey West\\n\\nRather than inhabiting a world of time wealth, we’re inhabiting a world of time poverty. Rather than feeling the luxury of time freedom, we’re feeling the burden of constant hurry.\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nHow did things turn out the exact opposite of what we were expecting?\\n\\nMore importantly, will the pace of life keep accelerating? And if it does, what are the implications (ie — can most people even cope)? What should we be doing now as knowledge workers to prepare for this future?\\n\\nSo, I spent over 100 hours reading the top 10 books related to these questions across the disciplines of sociology, technology, physics, evolution, business, and systems theory.\\n\\nI read Pressed for Time: The Acceleration of Life in Digital Capitalism by sociologist Judy Wajcman. I read The Sociology of Speed: Digital, Organizational, and Social Temporalities by ten sociologists. I read Scale: The Universal Laws of Life, Growth, and Death in Organisms, Cities, and Companies by physicist turned polymath Geoffrey West. I reread The Singularity Is Near by technologist and futurist Ray Kurzweil. I read The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by journalist Matt Ridley, PhD. I read about the Law Of Requisite Variety pioneered in the field of cybernetics. Finally, I read Competing Against Time: How Time-Based Competition is Reshaping Global Markets by management consultant George Stalk and Clockspeed: Winning Industry Control In The Age Of Temporary Advantage by MIT researcher Charles Fine.\\n\\nWhile each of these researchers provide a different perspective, they point to the same fundamental root cause…\\n\\nTime Is Accelerating Because Of The Red Queen Effect\\n\\nAt a fundamental level, life on earth must compete to stay alive. Predators and prey are in a never-ending race to evolve new abilities to avoid extinction. Rabbits that evolve longer ears to hear foxes survive more. Foxes that develop stronger legs to run faster catch more rabbits and don’t starve. And so on.\\n\\nMatt Ridley, author of The Red Queen Effect, explains the tit for tat like this…\\n\\nIf a competitor makes an improvement, you must make an equal or greater improvement just to stay neck-and-neck with them. Stay the same and you fall behind.\\n\\nLauren Bacall said it even better…\\n\\n“Standing still is the fastest way of moving backwards in a rapidly changing world.” — Lauren Bacall\\n\\nIn other words, evolution is a double-edged sword. On one hand, innovations increase survival. On the other hand, they also increase competition, which reduces survival.\\n\\nEvolution does not rest on its laurels. It accelerates.\\n\\nEnter humans.\\n\\nWith humans, we see a shift from competing based on biology to competing based on ideas (cultures, strategies, technologies, etc.). For example…\\n\\nCompanies compete for top talent. Employees compete for open positions.\\n\\nEmployees compete to move up the corporate ladder.\\n\\nCompanies compete for investors. Investors compete for the best startups.\\n\\nCompanies compete against each other via their products and services.\\n\\nScientists compete against each other for publication, citation, awards, and funding.\\n\\nEveryone competes for attention.\\n\\nJust like evolution, when we evolve new technologies, things don’t slow down and become a utopia. Rather things get faster and more competitive.\\n\\nNow, here’s where the big difference between biology and ideas is. While human biology evolves so slowly we don’t notice, ideas (cultures, strategies, technologies, etc.) evolve so quickly, we can’t keep up. Idea evolution is like biological evolution on steroids.\\n\\nIn other words, in a moment when many are already feeling overwhelmed by change, things are about to take off even faster. 20 years from now, the rate of change will be 4x what it is now. Things will keep accelerating from there, and in 40 years, it will be 16x (more on these numbers later).\\n\\nWhat does this mean?\\n\\nLet me put it in context. For many, 2020 felt like five years packed into one…\\n\\nHistoric pandemic\\n\\nHistoric social movement (Black Lives Matter)\\n\\nHistoric stimulus\\n\\nHistoric wildfires\\n\\nHistoric election\\n\\nHistoric stock market high\\n\\nHistoric technology breakthroughs (Alphafold / GPT-3 / Quantum Supremacy, etc)\\n\\nWe saw once-in-a-generation events in nearly every sphere of life. Each of these events rippled throughout society leading to unpredictable second-order effects which upended our long-held beliefs about media, democracy, business, and citizenship to name a few. Our emotions went from positive to negative extremes as we faced unprecedented opportunities and challenges. We had to fundamentally rethink our lives, relationships, and work.\\n\\nHere’s the thing though… 2020 isn’t a temporary blip before things go back to normal. It is the kickoff to an unprecedented acceleration that few have considered, let alone prepared for.\\n\\nIf time is like a treadmill, 2020 was running. The near-future will be an all out sprint.\\n\\nHow do we keep up?\\n\\nTo answer this question, let’s talk about…\\n\\nThe Coming Acceleration Shock\\n\\n“If somebody describes the world of the mid-twenty-first century to you and it doesn’t sound like science fiction, it is certainly false. We cannot be sure of the specifics; change itself is the only certainty.” — Yuval Noah Harari\\n\\nWhile both biology and ideas evolve exponentially, exponential growth is fundamentally different at different stages of the curve. It starts off slowly, but when it hits the knee of the curve, it grows explosively and profoundly.\\n\\nFor example, one researcher charted the Gross World Product from 10,000 BCE to 2019 and came up with this chart…\\n\\nWe are now living in the second half of the curve. This is a big deal, because the second half feels and behaves in fundamentally different ways.\\n\\nRay Kurzweil, the director of engineering at Google and arguably the world #1 futurist, breaks down what the second half of the exponential curve better than anyone else in his book, The Singularity Is Near.\\n\\nKurzweil’s basic premise is this…\\n\\n“The future will be far more surprising than most people realize.”\\n\\nThe reason it’ll be more surprising, he argues, is, “because few observers have truly internalized the implications of the fact that the rate of change itself is accelerating.” In other words, “an exponential curve looks like a straight line when examined for only a brief duration. As a result, even sophisticated commentators, when considering the future, typically extrapolate the current pace of change over the next ten years or one hundred years to determine their expectations.”\\n\\nLet’s break this down. When we look at a linear and exponential curve from a zoomed out perspective of more time, it’s easy to see the difference between the two curves…\\n\\nHowever, when we zoom into a small duration, the differences look more like this. Notice that the difference is almost impossible to see.\\n\\nFor example, I was born in 1981. When I think about the pace of change, it is hard for me to compare the change I experienced in my lifetime to the change experienced during 1940–1980. It’s like comparing apples to oranges. Furthermore, when I look at the last 40 years, major events blend together. The pace changes, but then I get used to it. It is hard to feel the exponential nature either way. Sure, I can intellectually understand exponential change, but I don’t feel it.\\n\\nThings get really interesting when Kurzweil shares the implications of this insight. It is the most profound, yet underappreciated idea from the book…\\n\\nIntroducing The 10-Year Rule\\n\\n“My models show that we are doubling the paradigm-shift rate every decade.” — Ray Kurzweil\\n\\nThis is the most interesting line in Kurzweil’s book in my opinion. This statement is profound, because it means the following…\\n\\nTo put this chart in context, 20 years from now, the rate of change will be 4x what is now. Said differently, for someone who is about 40 today, when they’re 60 in 2040, the rate of paradigm change will be 4x what it is now. They will experience a year of change (by today’s standards) in three months. For someone who is 10 today, when they’re 60, they’ll experience a year of change in 11 days.\\n\\nTo summarize the profundity of this 10-year doubling rate, Kurzweil says…\\n\\n“We won’t experience one hundred years of technological advance in the twenty-first century; we will witness on the order of twenty thousand years of progress (again, when measured by today’s rate of progress), or about one thousand times greater than what was achieved in the twentieth century.”\\n\\nLet that sink in for a second.\\n\\nSo what exactly is a paradigm and how did Kurzweil come up with this rate?\\n\\nTo create the 10-Year Rule, Kurzweil plotted the largest milestones of biological and technological development on a single graph…\\n\\nKurzweil’s key events roughly mirror reference books that have compiled the most important historical events (Encyclopaedia Britannica, the American Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan’s “cosmic calendar,” and others).\\n\\nOf course, because there is a trend in the past, it doesn’t mean it will continue in the future. But, the way I see it, if a trend has existed on Earth for a billion years, it’s worth at least planning for the possibility that it will happen in the next 20 years.\\n\\nAnd if you want to see how ridiculously predictable technological progress has been for the last 60 years, I recommend watching this video. It is awe-inspiring…\\n\\nThis quote captures the importance of Moore’s Law to the technology industry…\\n\\n“If Silicon Valley has a heartbeat, it’s Moore’s Law,” — Rob Enderle\\n\\nThis all begs the question…\\n\\nWhat would it mean to have the rate of paradigm changing events be 4x what it is now in 20 years?\\n\\nHow To Prepare For The Coming Acceleration Shock\\n\\n“When an industry is subjected to an important innovation, that industry typically feels a significant uptick in the overall clockspeed.” — Charles Fine (MIT)\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the rapid evolution of human culture, ideas, strategies, and technology is a double-edged sword. On one hand, innovations increase efficiency. On the other hand, it also increases competition.\\n\\nThis happens on three levels:\\n\\nRace against people. People and companies are using their efficiency gains to double down and gain further advantage thus increasing the competition even more. For example, in Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the tech, many of the smartest and wealthiest people in the world are working 60–80 hours per week and making sacrifices in their families, health and sleep in order to do so. Large salaries are put toward nannies, drivers, cleaners, and everything such that time at work can be maximized.\\n\\nPeople and companies are using their efficiency gains to double down and gain further advantage thus increasing the competition even more.

Large salaries are put toward nannies, drivers, cleaners, and everything such that time at work can be maximized. Race against machines. To compete on costs, companies are using robots and AI to eliminate jobs. In the economics literature, this is known as the race against machines. Many technologies automate old jobs and create the opportunities for new jobs. But, to take advantage of these opportunities, individuals must be able to “race” faster than machines by learning new skills. We see the harbingers of automation with cashierless stores (3.6M jobs in US) and autonomous vehicles (2M truck drivers in US) and robofactories (12M+ manufacturing jobs in US). These three job categories alone account for over 10% of the US workforce, and they’re almost guaranteed to precipitously downsize in the next 10 years.\\n\\nTo compete on costs, companies are using robots and AI to eliminate jobs.

These three job categories alone account for over 10% of the US workforce, and they’re almost guaranteed to precipitously downsize in the next 10 years. Race against the world. Digitization has taken extreme competition to a whole other level. Rather than competing against the best in your local area, you’re competing against the best in the world. In other words, rather than competing against a small number of people, you’re competing against 1,000x the number of people. The result of global competition is that competition is exponentially more fierce and winner-take-all.\\n\\nI first experienced what it was like to go from local to global competition while I grew up playing tennis. I was #1 player on my high school tennis team for all four years. And, I was one of the top five players in the state for my age. This meant I went into nearly every match expecting to win. A few times I even played several points with my opposite hand out of boredom.\\n\\nThings flipped when I went to a national level. I expected to always lose unless I got lucky. The players there weren’t just a little bit better, they were dominant. I felt like a mouse being played with by a cat. Like a perpetual outsider.\\n\\nAt the global level, these dominant US players were dominated by the international competition. Then, at the next professional level when all of the top global players are thrown into one pile no matter their age, only the top 100 or so players make enough money to even play tennis full-time. Then, within the top professional players, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic have combined to win 57 of the past 67 Slams. Out of all of the hundreds of men’s professional tennis players, only three account for almost all of the attention, prize money, and endorsements over the last decade. It’s brutal when you think about it. That’s what it’s like when markets go global and digital.\\n\\nWhat does the extreme competition mean?\\n\\nOn the positive side, this increasing competition creates incredible innovation. As consumers, we have people racing to serve needs we didn’t even realize we had faster, cheaper, and better.\\n\\nOn the negative side, as workers, we are the ones racing to serve customers. It feels like we’re on a treadmill and that if we get off that treadmill to smell the roses of life for too long, we may fall irreparably behind. If there isn’t always a direct threat we can see, there is always the implied threat. For example, there is now a large literature of megacompanies who were disrupted by garage startups because their innovation rate slowed and their hubris swelled.\\n\\nMatt Ridley sums up the situation in this quote…\\n\\n“One of the peculiar features of history is that time always erodes advantage. Every invention sooner or later leads to a counterinvention. Every success contains the seeds of its own overthrow. Every hegemony comes to an end. Evolutionary history is no different. Progress and success are always relative… In history and in evolution, progress is always a futile, Sisyphean struggle to stay in the same relative place by getting ever better at things.” — Matt Ridley\\n\\nSome harbingers of this reality are already around us.\\n\\nFor starters, the lifespan of companies on the Fortune 500 is shrinking. Charles Fine, MIT researcher and author of Clockspeed puts these numbers in context, “The faster the industry clockspeed, the shorter the half-life of competitive advantage.”\\n\\nWe’re also seeing inequality skyrocket. One of the craziest statistics here is that the world’s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than 4.6 billion people combined, according to Oxfam. Even more surprising, the 26 richest people own as much as the poorest 50%. It’s astounding.\\n\\nWe can also see how the pace of life has increased on many other levels…\\n\\nMovies have faster cuts. When my kids were younger, I took it as an opportunity to rewatch the first Star Wars. It was too slow to keep my attention.\\n\\nMore and more people are fast forwarding media content. Netflix recently added the ability to watch all of its shows at 1.5x speed. Even Audible recently increased its max speed from 3x to 3.5x.\\n\\nOur language is becoming shorter, more informal, and filled with acronyms…\\n\\nWe’re seeing book summary websites get venture capital and now websites that offer book summaries of book summaries.\\n\\nNot too long ago, Google Calendar added 15 minute increments. Will it soon copy Elon Musk’s 5-minute increments?\\n\\nFinally, we’ve all heard about increasing rates of anxiety. Many times social media usage and technology devices are scapegoated as the root cause. But maybe all of these are part of a deeper phenomenon… time acceleration.\\n\\nWhat We Can Do About Time Acceleration In Our Careers\\n\\n“In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products but above all to reinvent yourself again and again.” — Yuval Noah Harari\\n\\nTo recap, we are on the precipice of an era of extreme competition — which means that the amount and pace of competition will accelerate 4x in the next 20 years.\\n\\nIf you don’t prepare now, you will be progressively outcompeted and overwhelmed.\\n\\nSo the question becomes, how do you want to run the race?\\n\\nA few options emerge…\\n\\nFollow the pace of the crowd: In other words, do what most people are doing (i.e. get a 9–5 job and do what’s expected of you). This is the least stressful option in the short-term, but you risk falling behind in the long-term. Work harder than others: This helps you progress in your career faster, but you sacrifice time with family & friends along with personal health… not to mention that you risk losing out to people who are learning more than you. Outlearn others and let your knowledge compound: Learning is the ultimate productivity hack. In other words, it provides the greatest leverage. It’s the tool that the greatest innovators and business thinkers of our time (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and others) use to get ahead.\\n\\nI’ve personally gone with option #3 because of the power of the 5-Hour Rule…\\n\\nThe 5-Hour Rule: The Antidote To The Exploding Pace Of Modern Life\\n\\n“Read 500 pages every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.” — Warren Buffett\\n\\nThe 5-Hour Rule is the surprising pattern that many of the busiest and most successful people in the world find at least 5 hours per week for learning.\\n\\nThe beauty of the 5-Hour Rule is that you don’t have to work yourself to death, you can have fun learning, and you don’t have to make huge personal sacrifices.\\n\\nWhen you set aside an hour in your day for deliberate learning, your productivity for the day may decrease, but your productivity over your life skyrockets as your knowledge compounds.\\n\\nOver time, you are living more and more off of the compound interest from your learning. As a result, you can go faster and faster with less and less effort.\\n\\nAnd that’s why I spend 3–4 hours per day learning as an entrepreneur.\\n\\nHow To Apply The 5-Hour Rule To Your Life\\n\\nIf you see the power of learning like I do, I would love to support you on your learning journey.\\n\\nThis article is the first in my free training series on how to learn and succeed in the radically different future we’re all entering.

              "   \"Money\\n\\nGenerating Passive Income Is Hard, Here Is a Better Option\\n\\nThe highest level of financial freedom is having enough passive income to cover your living expenses. If you manage to reach that point, you can spend your days doing whatever makes you happiest.\\n\\nIf passive income is the key to financial freedom, then anyone who can enable others to generate passive income will be able to wield massive influence and make themselves wealthy. That is why the internet is full of spammy articles and videos, promising easy solutions to generate passive income.\\n\\nHere is the brutal truth about passive income.\\n\\nGenerating enough passive income to cover your living expenses takes years, if not decades. Anyone who promises to show you how to quickly generate passive income is either trying to sell you something or has no idea what they are talking about.\\n\\nIn this article, I explain the only way to generate passive income, why it takes so long, and an alternative to passive income that has the same impact and can be implemented immediately.\\n\\nThere is only one source of passive income\\n\\nIf someone is trying to sell you their “system to generate passive income,” remember an important truth; the only true source of passive income comes from income generated by investments.\\n\\nI’m talking rent from real estate, dividends from stocks, and interest from bonds. So, If someone is offering you passive income, ask them when they plan on transferring these investments over to your name.\\n\\nWhat most people think of as passive income is actually “scalable income,” which is another way of saying business income. There is no limit on how much you can earn, but you aren’t guaranteed a dime.\\n\\nI’ve covered the difference between passive income and scalable income in great detail here. The primary take away is that scalable income is incredible, but it’s the furthest thing from “passive.”\\n\\nThe holy grail of personal finance: passive income > living expenses\\n\\nWe’ve already touched on the importance of passive income. Once you have enough of it, you officially have “F-You” money.\\n\\nHaving F-You money means you have power. The power to do whatever you want without worrying about how you’ll pay the bills.\\n\\nBut here is the crappy part. Generating enough passive income to have F-You money takes years, and if we are being realistic, probably decades.\\n\\nWhy building passive income is a slow process\\n\\nThe best way to illustrate why it takes so long to build F-You money is with a simple example.\\n\\nLet’s assume the following.\\n\\nYou’re 30.\\n\\nYou make $50,000 per year after tax.\\n\\nYour annual living expenses are $40,000.\\n\\nThat leaves you with $10,000 per year to invest in assets that yield approximately 3.5% in passive income.\\n\\nTo cover your entire $40,000 annual living expenses entirely with passive income, you would need $1,143,000 invested. If you were saving $10,000 per year, it would take 38 years.\\n\\nSaving 20% of your income, starting at age 30, would mean you would have enough passive income to cover your living expenses by age 68. What I am describing has a name; it’s is called retirement planning.\\n\\nYes, for most people working a 9–5 job, they will be at around retirement age before they have true F-You money.\\n\\nNow that I have thoroughly depressed you let’s talk about the good news.\\n\\nHow you can recreate the impact of passive income without waiting 38 years\\n\\nRemember the holy grail equation of personal finance: passive income > living expenses.\\n\\nThere are two components of that equation.\\n\\nYour level of passive income. The amount of your living expenses.\\n\\nWe spend so much time discussing the first part of that equation and not nearly enough talking about the second part.\\n\\nI have another truth for you, and this time it should excite you.\\n\\nReducing your living expenses has the exact same impact on your finances as increasing your passive income\\n\\nIn fact, reducing your living expenses is better than increasing your passive income for a number of reasons.\\n\\nIt has the exact same impact on your monthly cash flow . spending $500 less is the same as making $500 more.\\n\\n. spending $500 less is the same as making $500 more. It’s more tax-efficient . At a 30% marginal tax rate, cutting $500 in monthly expenses is equivalent to generating $715 in monthly passive income.\\n\\n. At a 30% marginal tax rate, cutting $500 in monthly expenses is equivalent to generating $715 in monthly passive income. You can achieve this increase in cash-flow instantly.\\n\\nHow cutting your expenses reduces the time to F-You money\\n\\nLet’s return to our example, where you clear $50,000 per year and spend $40,000. We found that it would take 38 years to generate enough passive income to have F-You money.\\n\\nWhat if you were reduced your annual spending from $40,000 to $30,000?\\n\\nSince you only need $30,000 to cover your annual living expenses with passive income, you would only need $857,000 rather than $1,143,000.\\n\\nNow that you are saving $20,000 per year, it would only take you 23 years to generate enough passive income to cover your living expenses. That shaved off 15 years of the process.\\n\\nThere are two big takeaways from this.\\n\\nThe lower your annual living expenses, the less passive income you’ll need. Every dollar of living expenses you cut can be redirected to saving more, which helps you reach F-You money faster.\\n\\nIf you're serious about cutting your expenses, here are two articles I would recommend you read.\\n\\nHow to speed things up even more\\n\\nOnce you have cut your living expenses down to the lowest number you are comfortable with, there is another step you can take if you want to accelerate your timeline to F-You money.\\n\\nIncrease your income doing something you love, while maintaining your current living expenses.\\n\\nIf you can find a way to make money doing something you love, then your timeline to F-You money and financial freedom may be closer than you ever imagined.\\n\\nLet’s return to our example one final time and illustrate the impact of lowering your living expenses from $40,000 to $30,000 per year and adding $10,000 per year from a side hustle you have passion for.\\n\\nOur goal remained the same; save $857,000 to provide $30,000 in annual passive income.\\n\\nBy adding the $10,000 inside hustle income, you have increased your savings to $30,000 per year.\\n\\nIn this scenario, you would have F-You money in about 18 years, shaving an additional 5 years off your timeline.\\n\\nThe final step of financial freedom\\n\\nBear with me for one more moment because I have one final point I need to make.\\n\\nIf, in this scenario, you can make $10,000 per year doing something you truly love, then you don’t need to cover your entire $30,000 in living expenses with passive income. You only need to cover $20,000 with passive income.\\n\\nThat would mean you only need to save $571,000. That would mean you can achieve financial freedom in just over 13 years, even if you were starting from scratch.\\n\\nThe more money you can earn doing something you love, the less passive income you need\\n\\nDon’t obsess over passive income\\n\\nThe focus on passive income has reached an unhealthy point. You shouldn’t pin all of your hopes on the pipe dream that in a few short years, you could have enough passive income to quit your job.\\n\\nFor the average person working a 9–5 job, it would likely take until they reach retirement age before they have F-You money.\\n\\nHowever, there are actionable steps you can take to speed up that timeline and achieve financial freedom while you are young enough to enjoy it.\\n\\nCut your expenses to the lowest level you are comfortable with. Increase your income, possibly through a side hustle. Look for a job, a business, or a side hustle that you love. Every dollar of money you can make doing something you love is one less dollar of passive income you’ll need.\\n\\nFinancial freedom is not a get-rich-quick scheme; it’s a long and deliberate process. It won’t be easy, but you absolutely have what it takes.\",\n",

              "   'The Experience\\n\\nScreenshots don’t do it justice. Videos fail to capture the scale and grandeur of the experience. These pictures are a poor illustration of what I see in the headset—low resolution, compressed field-of-view, lacking depth and scale. The low display down front? That’s the size of an executive desk. The code is like an IMAX® theater—I can’t even see all of it at once.\\n\\nEntire libraries at a glance\\n\\nWhat’s it like to actually use? In a word: comfortable. Given a few more words, I’d choose productive and effective. I can resize, reposition, add, or remove as much screen space as I need. I never have to squint or lean forward, crane my neck, hunt for an application window I just had open, or struggle to find a place for something. Many trade-offs and compromises from the past no longer apply — I put my apps in convenient locations I can see at a glance, and without getting in my way. I move myself and my gaze enough throughout the day that I’m not stiff at the end of it and experience less eye strain than I ever did with a bunch of desk-bound LCDs.\\n\\nComplete control over my visual environment is like using noise-canceling headphones for my eyes. I can choose the levels of color energy and busyness best suited to whatever I’m focusing on, usually minimizing contrast the same way you would with a bias light for TVs. I’ll float in a nebula while looking at code in a dark IDE, chill out on Olympus in a sunset cloudscape while composing slides for a presentation, or overlook a tropical lagoon while grinding through email. Anything I’m doing, I’m doing with complete focus in a perfectly matched atmosphere.\\n\\nYou truly belong here with us among the clouds.\\n\\nI tend to prefer simple 360-degree photos over more elaborate environments out of practical consideration: my displays are larger than will fit in any reasonable facsimile of an indoor setting — it doesn’t really work to cram a movie theater into a café. There are plenty of those environments from which to choose, and I expect the collection will keep growing as the system continues to mature (eventually incorporating real-world Augmented Reality elements). An alpine chalet with a crackling fireplace as snow gently falls outside? Check. A hipster coffee salon? Covered — a popular place for hanging out with other users. Or an open-walled wooden lodge with a variety of times and weather available, a grand corporate plaza with a waterfall, etc., etc. Outside of managing performance, there are no limits on what kind of environments are possible.\\n\\nI’ve found it useful to play around with those environments, too: in the coffee shop setting I overlaid a piece of artwork on the wall with one of my screens, turning it into a TV for a more realistic ambience. In the plaza, I re-created a lecture hall by using one display as a stand-in for the projector showing my slides, another as my lectern-mounted laptop with speaker notes, and a “talk timer” display in the front row. By practicing my presentation for a semi-annual company retreat (pre-COVID) and ironing out the flow I earned one of the highest speaker review scores of the entire week—it went exactly as rehearsed in a near-identical real-world setup.\\n\\nThis kind of comfort and productivity isn’t automatic or accidental, it’s something I consciously refine to maximize the human side of my work equation. It’s also not limitless; I’ve traded one set of compromises for another, optimizing for a different set of concerns more in line with my needs. I worked up to my full-time schedule, became accustomed to the weight and fit of the headset, manage the temperature and airflow of my office as needed, and regularly clean the contact surfaces. I take periodic breaks to hydrate, stretch my legs, and recharge myself.\\n\\nI’ve lightly accessorized the headset too: replaced the stock facial foam with more thickly padded polyurethane-leather ($30), changed the head strap for a halo mount ($50), and added prescription lenses to eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses ($70), altogether increasing the cost 50% over the base price of the Quest 2 (not that I paid the base price — I ordered a model with higher storage capacity, and this is only my latest headset). I treat the entire rig as a business expense/investment and am not disappointed.\\n\\nThere have been some delightful surprises on the application side, too. Using regular software in that virtual environment is still like using that regular software, albeit with a lot more elbow room. There are a few notable exceptions though — the ones that really benefit from the increased real estate are those involving visual communications: when “seeing the big picture” is no longer metaphorical, and you can make out the fine details at the same time (forest + trees). A stand-out example is the very aptly named MURAL, which when given an entire wall (or movie screen) can be a sublime experience in creativity and shared comprehension.\\n\\nSome old-school tools are similarly supercharged: an eight-way (or more) tmux / vim split with multiple files, terminals, unit tests, and logs, creates a massive kind of working memory — maintaining end-to-end context in otherwise sprawling complexity.\\n\\nApart Together: the Shared Experience\\n\\nBigscreen VR Selfie\\n\\nMeetings are best in person, in VR, in MURAL, and in Zoom — in that order. As a remote worker of several years, “in person” is a rarity for me — so I use VR to preserve the feeling of shared presence, of inhabiting a place with other people, especially when good spatial audio is used. Hand tracking enables meaningful gestures and animated expression, despite the avatars cartoonish appearance — somehow it all “just works”, your brain accepts that these people you know are embodied through these virtual puppets, and you get on with communicating instead of quibbling about missing realism (which will be a welcome improvement as it becomes available but doesn’t stop this from working right now).\\n\\nI’m calling out MURAL again because of an important finding from VR collaboration: sometimes being in the same place and looking at the same stuff is a good way to meet, and remains the standard in conference rooms across the globe — but the term “Death by PowerPoint” was not coined ex nihilo. Countering PowerPoint prison by giving each person their own view of shared content, under their own control, is a big step depending on the content. If it’s still slides, all you’ve done is invent “meeting TiVo” — Google Docs is an improvement, though still confined by its linearity. MURAL’s working canvas, on the other hand, invites people to browse ideas and their connections seemingly effortlessly, jumping forward, back, and around as needed: context turns seeing into understanding. The best measures of this are the kinds of questions asked, the conversations sparked, and the palpable engagement “in the room”.\\n\\nThe important finding is how that works: people in the Immersed software can join the same space and choose whether to share their screens with each other. I can sit right next to someone and we each have our own giant screens completely invisible to the other — no obstructions to the conversation. Shared space for communication, local independent space for productivity. It’s kind of like hanging out with everyone and their imaginary friends (screens) and removes any distraction from the collaboration process. It’s a real trip to experience, and incredibly freeing.\\n\\nLip-synced, hand-tracked, webcam doppelganger\\n\\nFor meeting with those not in VR, or if I have a video call that needs input rather than passive attendance, I’ll frequently use a virtual webcam to attend by avatar. It’s sufficiently demonstrative for most team meetings, and the crew has gotten used to me showing up as a digital facsimile. I’ll surface from VR and use a physical webcam for anything sensitive or personal, however.\\n\\nA special note about Horizon Workrooms, since that’s new and big on the scene: they’ve done an excellent job of creating a high-end virtual meeting room that feels and acts “like the real thing.”\\n\\nHorizon workroom with a pancake-screen participant\\n\\nIt has a ton of promise, but… I don’t really care for the promise it’s making. 100% of what you can do in Workrooms is feasible in a physical setting, although it would be really expensive (lots of smart hardware all over the place). But that’s the thing: it’s imitating life within a tool that doesn’t share the same limitations, so as a VR veteran I find it bland and claustrophobic. That’s going to be really good for newcomers or casual users because the skeuomorphism is familiar, making it easy to immediately orient oneself and begin working together — and that illustrates a challenge in design vocabulary. While the familiar can provide a safe and comfortable starting point, the real power of VR requires training users for potentially unfamiliar use cases. Also, if you can be anywhere, why would you want to be in a meeting room, virtual-Lake Tahoe notwithstanding?\\n\\nExploring VR collaboration in any depth will require a separate article (probably a series of them). The field is shifting rapidly, and there are many options and considerations — check out the “See Also” section in the Appendix for good references to people currently exploring this. What I would say, in addition to the above, is that while VR isn’t perfect, combined with the accessibility and quality-of-life benefits of Working From Anywhere it remains my number-one choice (and if I were in-the-office or otherwise colocated? I would still use the headset at my desk to turn my cubicle into a cavernous expanse).',\n",

              "   \"This looks similar to an Excel spreadsheet, but in this format, it’ll be easier to wrangle the data. Now I’ll show you in Python how to do some common functions you probably used in Excel.\\n\\nSum, Average, Max, Min, Count\\n\\nExcel’s popular functions can be easily replaced with Pandas methods. Let’s take a look.\\n\\nColumns (e.g. sum a column)\\n\\nIf we want to get most of the functions listed above, we use the .describe() method.\\n\\ndf_excel.describe()\\n\\nImage by author\\n\\nAs you can see, with this we get the count, mean, max, and min values of all numerical columns.\\n\\nHowever, if we want to select a specific row, we first select with square brackets [ ] and then use the method we need ( .sum() , .mean() , etc.). For example, let’s calculate the average of math scores.\\n\\nIn [1]: df_excel['math score'].mean()\\n\\nOut [1]: 66.089\\n\\nThese are some of the other methods you can use.\\n\\ndf_excel['math score'].mean()\\n\\ndf_excel['math score'].max()\\n\\ndf_excel['math score'].min()\\n\\ndf_excel['math score'].count()\\n\\nRows (e.g. sum a row)\\n\\nNow let’s say we want to calculate the average of the 3 marks (math, reading, and writing). Those values are within different columns, so we have 2 options. We can either sum each column\\n\\ndf_excel['average'] = (df_excel['math score'] + df_excel['reading score'] + df_excel['writing score'])/3\\n\\nOr use the method we used before to sum values within a column, but in this case, we add axis=1\\n\\ndf_excel['average'] = df_excel.mean(axis=1)\\n\\nWe also added a new column [‘average’] when calculating the average. We’ll use this new column for the next section ( IF ).\\n\\nKeep in mind that in this example we could use the second option because the only numerical values are within the desired columns ( (math, reading, and writing scores). If there was an additional column we don’t want to consider in the sum, we should only use the first option.\\n\\nIn case we want to count the number of specific data within a column, we can use the .value_counts() method\\n\\nIn [2]: df_excel['gender'].value_counts()\\n\\nOut [2]:\\n\\nfemale 518\\n\\nmale 482\\n\\nIF\\n\\nWe can easily replace Excel’s IF function by using Numpy.\\n\\nReplace IF with np.where\\n\\nLet’s imagine we want to know whether a student has passed or failed an exam and create a new column with that information. We can easily do that with the following code.\\n\\ndf_excel['pass/fail'] = np.where(df_excel['average'] > 70, 'Pass', 'Fail')\\n\\nAs you can see np.where() needs 3 arguments — the condition, the value if the condition is True, and the value if the condition is False.\\n\\nReplace nested IF with np.select\\n\\nLet’s imagine we want to give grades from A to F based on the scores obtained. In this case, we have more than 2 values, so we use np.select()\\n\\nnp.select() needs to arguments — a list of conditions and a list of values. A list in Python is represented by the square brackets [ ]\\n\\nconditions = [\\n\\n(df_excel['average']>=90),\\n\\n(df_excel['average']>=80) & (df_excel['average']<90),\\n\\n(df_excel['average']>=70) & (df_excel['average']<80),\\n\\n(df_excel['average']>=60) & (df_excel['average']<70),\\n\\n(df_excel['average']>=50) & (df_excel['average']<60),\\n\\n(df_excel['average']<50),\\n\\n] values = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\\n\\nKeep in mind that each condition should be within parenthesis. Now we use the .select() method and assign it to a new [‘grades’] column.\\n\\ndf_excel['grades'] = np.select(conditions, values)\\n\\nNow the first 5 rows of the output should look like this.\\n\\nImage by author\\n\\nWe picked these 3 columns with double square brackets df_excel[[ ‘average’, ‘pass/fail’, ‘grades’ ]] and the first 5 rows can be displayed with the .head() method.\\n\\nSumIf, CountIf, AverageIf\\n\\nTo sum, count, or calculate the average based on a condition, in Python, we first filter out values and then make the calculation.\\n\\nOne condition (select a column with square brackets [ ] )\\n\\nLet’s imagine we want to sum the scores for only the female gender. To do so, first, we write the condition df_excel[‘gender’] == ‘female’ and then. we select that condition inside the df_excel frame by using square brackets [ ]\\n\\ndf_female = df_excel[df_excel['gender'] == 'female']\\n\\nWe selected only the female gender and placed it in a dataframe called df_female . Now we can perform any calculation we saw in the “Sum, Average, Max, Min, Count” section.\\n\\nTwo or more conditions (select columns and use & or |)\\n\\nIf we have two or more conditions, the code will look similar to the one above, but with some changes. Let’s imagine we want to calculate the score of females within Group B (‘race/ethnicity’)\\n\\ndf_sumifs = df_excel[(df_excel['gender'] == 'female') & (df_excel['race/ethnicity'] == 'group B')]\\n\\nSince there are 2 conditions we could use & | that represents and/or respectively. Keep in mind that each condition should be within parenthesis.\\n\\nNow let’s sum the scores.\\n\\ndf_sumifs = df_sumifs.assign(sumifs = df_sumifs['math score'] + df_sumifs['reading score'] + df_sumifs['writing score'])\\n\\nIn this case, I used the .assign() method to show you another way to create a new column while doing calculations.\\n\\nBasic Data Cleaning\\n\\nWe’re going to check a few methods used for data cleaning. In case you want to know all the methods used for cleaning data, check the complete guide I wrote on how to clean and prepare data in Python.\\n\\nWe’ll continue using the df_excel frame we defined before.\\n\\nChange the case of text with .str.lower, .str.upper or .str.title\\n\\nTo access the strings contained in a column, we use .str Then we can change the case of text with the following\\n\\ndf_excel['gender'].str.title()\\n\\ndf_excel['gender'].str.upper()\\n\\ndf_excel['gender'].str.title()\\n\\nTo save the values we can overwrite a column like in the code below.\\n\\ndf_excel['gender'] = df_excel['gender'].str.title()\\n\\nBut in this case, we’ll leave the values as it is.\\n\\nExtract text in a column with .str.extract\\n\\nWe can easily extract text from a column with .str.extract . In addition to that, if we want to extract specific patterns of a text we can use regular expressions.\\n\\nLet’s imagine we want to extract only the words in upper case within the column ‘race/ethnicity’ (e.g., “B” from “Group B”). To do so, we write the following code.\\n\\ndf_excel['race/ethnicity'].str.extract(r'([A-Z])')\\n\\nIn this case, we used the regular expression r'([A-Z])’ where [A-Z] indicate words in upper case, while the parenthesis () is necessary to pick the desired pattern. Regular expressions might look intimidating, but they’re simpler than you think. In the link below, you’ll find a simple guide I made to easily learn regular expressions.\\n\\nIdentify whether a cell is empty with the .isnull method\\n\\nTo replace Excel’s COUNTA, in Python we can use .isnull() to find empty values.\\n\\ndf_excel[df_excel['gender'].isnull()]\\n\\nIn this case, there are no empty values so the result will be an empty dataframe.\\n\\nVlookup\\n\\nTo find elements as Vlookup does in Excel, we’re going to use .loc[] , .merge() or .concat() based on the problem we want to solve.\\n\\nOnly for these examples, we’re going to work with 2 Excel spreadsheets. The first is the same “StudentsPerformance” we’ve been working with so far, while the second is a CSV file named “LanguageScore” that I created with random id and language score values (you can find this file on my Github). Let’s read both files with pd.read_csv() as we did before.\\n\\nexcel_1 = 'StudentsPerformance.csv'\\n\\nexcel_2 = 'LanguageScore.csv' df_excel_1 = pd.read_csv(excel_1)\\n\\ndf_excel_2 = pd.read_csv(excel_2)\\n\\nNow we’re going to create an id column on df_excel_1 so it has a column in common with df_excel_2 . To do so, we run the following code.\\n\\ndf_excel_1 = df_excel_1.reset_index()\\n\\ndf_excel_1 = df_excel_1.rename(columns={'index':'id'})\\n\\nAs you can see, I made an id column based on the index. reset_index() gets rid of the index by adding it as a column. You can drop the index doing .reset_index(drop=True) but in this case, I’ll rename this new index column by using the .rename() method. With this, we have a new id column.\\n\\nFind an element with .loc[ ]\\n\\nFinding an element using Pandas is as easy as writing .loc[] . Inside [] we have to include the row and column label. Ler’s find the information related to row 100.\\n\\nIn [3]: df_excel_1.loc[100, ]\\n\\nOut [3]: id 100\\n\\ngender male\\n\\nrace/ethnicity group B\\n\\nparental level of education some college\\n\\nlunch standard\\n\\ntest preparation course none\\n\\nmath score 79\\n\\nreading score 67\\n\\nwriting score 67\\n\\nWe can also set conditions. For example, we want to get the math score for the student with id equal to 100.\\n\\nIn [3]: df_excel_1.loc[df_excel_1['id']==100, 'math score']\\n\\nOut [3]:\\n\\n100 79\\n\\nName: math score, dtype: int64\\n\\nThis means that the student with id 100 got score 79 in math.\\n\\nMerge two tables with pd.merge or pd.concat\\n\\nLet’s imagine you want to add the language score of all students who gave the exam. In this case, we use pd.merge() . This requires that 2 tables have 1 common column. In this case, this column is the id column.\\n\\ndf_excel_3 = pd.merge(df_excel_1, df_excel_2, on='id', how='left')\\n\\ndf_excel_3['language score'].fillna('0', inplace=True)\\n\\nAbove you can see that another argument is needed (how) . This indicates how the merge is performed. Left and right will have df_excel_1 and df_excel_2 as a reference for the final result, while inner will only give the common data inside the id column.\\n\\nYou can also use pd.concat() for the same purposes, but you have to set the id as index before concatenating frames and include the frames as lists (within brackets [] )\\n\\ndf_excel_3 = pd.concat(\\n\\n[df_excel_1.set_index('id'), df_excel_2.set_index('id')], axis=1\\n\\n)\\n\\ndf_excel_3['language score'].fillna('0', inplace=True)\\n\\ndf_excel_3\\n\\nAll the values that don’t match will receive a NaN, but we can replace it with any value by using the .fillna() method.\\n\\nPivot Table\\n\\nUse the .pivot_table method\\n\\nThe Pandas’ pivot_table method works similarly to the one you find in Excel.\\n\\nLet’s imagine we want to obtain the math and writing score of all the groups inside the race/ethnicity column.\\n\\ndf_excel = pd.read_csv('StudentsPerformance.csv') df_pivot = df_excel.pivot_table(index='race/ethnicity', values=['math score', 'writing score'], aggfunc='mean')\\n\\ndf_pivot\\n\\nThe index argument will group the ‘race/ethnicity’ column, while the values argument will take the numerical values to show. Finally, the calculations are made by the aggfunc . In this case, we pick the mean. As a result, we obtain the following pivot table.\\n\\nImage by author\\n\\nReplace Excel Graphs with Python’s Matplotlib or Seaborn\\n\\nPython contains different libraries to make visualizations as good as those Excel offers.\\n\\nLet’s make a simple barplot based on the results of df_pivot we created above. First, we import matplotlib and then we use plt.bar()\\n\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt df_plot = df_pivot.reset_index()\\n\\nplt.bar(df_plot['race/ethnicity'], df_plot['math score'])\\n\\nplt.show()\\n\\nThe first argument of plt.bar() is the label and the second is the numeric value. Then we display the results with plt.show()\\n\\nImage by author\\n\\nThere are many things you can do in a Python plot such as adding labels to the graph, titles, customizing the size of the figure and colors, but that’s a whole new topic. I already made a guide to make beautiful visualizations in Python which includes lineplots, barplot, piecharts, histograms, boxplots, etc. Check it out in the link below.\",\n",

Those challenges can be internal — the desire for more spontaneity, a blip in the usual schedule, a change of environment. They can also be external — pressure from colleagues to change, a new piece of software requirements, a change of atmosphere.\\n\\nAnd there’s a further element to that quote from Vision:\\n\\n“Challenge incites conflict. And conflict breeds catastrophe.”\\n\\nI believe that trust in your process — and its strength — can stave off that conflict. Or at least temper it. That way you can avoid the last phase: catastrophe.\\n\\nSo the next time you think about whether or not you should put a process in place to help you do your best work and live your best life (or strive to strengthen a process already in place), remember that a strong process invites challenge. But you can meet the challenges of life far better with the process than without one.',\n",

              "   'To remain valuable in our economy, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you are likely to fall behind as technology advances ~ Cal Newport\\n\\nCheck out the Animated Deep Work Summary!\\n\\nAt a time when every one of us is constantly bombarded by emails, meeting requests, tight deadlines and requests from bosses and co-workers — the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task can be seemingly impossible.\\n\\nBut, fear not, not all is lost.\\n\\nDeep work is the antidote that just might do the trick for you.\\n\\nWhat Is Deep Work?\\n\\nThe author defines it as: professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration (this is key!) that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate.\\n\\nSounds complicated, but it really isn’t. Let me show you how you can start benefiting from it with just 4 steps.\\n\\nStep 1) Identify what is deep work in your case\\n\\nYou cannot do deep work if you don’t know what that is.\\n\\nTake the time to figure out what type of activity will produce the absolute best stuff you are capable of. Keep in mind that you are the only judge of what activity that is.What might work for someone (or for everyone) might not the what works for you.\\n\\nDecide what deep work is for yourself, don’t be influenced by what is generally accepted.\\n\\nStep 2) Turn deep work into a ritual\\n\\nInstead of having random periods of potential deep work, schedule regular blocks of deep work — every day.\\n\\nBy removing the unknown timing and by not relying on willpower to get started, you are setting yourself up for success.\\n\\nStep 3) Eliminate distractions\\n\\nYeah, yeah, I know what you are thinking — that you are not distracted. That you have already creating the perfect environment for work. I hear ya! But, there is always something more you can do. Trust me!\\n\\nStart by choosing a working space that is dedicated to deep work. Put your phone away, disconnect your computer from the internet if not needed and remove noise, thirst, hunger and potentially other people from the equation.\\n\\nIn the same manner, try to eliminate, minimize or at the very least bulk the minial work together and leave it for the end of the day. Treat less important work as a form of distraction and leave it for when your deep work has been finished.\\n\\nStep 4) Have a shutdown routine\\n\\nDecide on a hard work cut off time. No work, deep or shallow is to be done past this point. This will allow you enough time to relax and recharge for the next day.\\n\\nCreate a work shutdown routine for yourself. That might involve checking your messages one last time to make sure there is nothing urgent, making a plan for the following day or reviewing your work. Whatever it it is, get it done and no more work is allowed after that.\\n\\nYour Turn Now\\n\\nAnd there you have it, the 4 steps to becoming a deep work master. It takes practice, it takes dedication, but you owe it to yourself to put it to use.\\n\\nIf you ever need a refresher on the Deep Work concepts, you can always check out the animated review .\\n\\nTry it out and let me know how it works by leaving a comment below. And, if you have been doing Deep Work for a while, curious to know how it’s going.',\n",

              "   'Do you ever think how amazing it would feel to make the tasks in your to do list disappear and accomplish everything you set out for the day, so you can go home early then continue where you left off with your favorite Netflix show? However, more often, life won’t go as planned, especially when you are working on a complex project with so many team members. By day’s end, the team’s shared task list looks like a matrix and no one would ever know where to get started. With so many team members working on the same list, it’s mostly impossible to identify your tasks and how to connect all the dots together.\\n\\nWe know you’ve tried your best to optimize your productivity, but sometimes life gets in the way. At Quire, we never let the stress win and make you feel less of yourself. It’s not you, it’s the way your team works with the to do list. Today, in order to solve the frustration and distraction problems once and for all, we introduce you with the ultimate Quire Sublist — the feature that will change the way you deal with your task list forever.\\n\\nPersonalize the Way You View Your Team Goals\\n\\nWe’ve all been through this: sitting in conference rooms for hours on end where nothing gets done. Everyone has the same proposal and same action plan, but somehow you look at the eye of your teammates and you realize you two share the same feeling: I have absolutely no idea what is going on.\\n\\nLost in translation happens more often than you thought. No matter how good your communication skill is, everyone has very different ideas when it comes to interpreting a to do list. The tasks that matter to a manager may not mean that much to a staff. Letting team members have the ability to create a personalized list is the secret to getting things done.\\n\\nTip: You can create as many sublists as you want and set different view permission for each sublist.\\n\\nFor one project in Quire, you can have as many sublists as you wish. For example, you might create a sublist named Design Reference and put all of the tasks/subtasks that are related to the task of Design Reference . Instead of creating a matrix of tags that drive all of the project members crazy, with your own personalized sublist, you can focus on the right tasks at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.\\n\\nAnd when you are working with the sublists, you can always switch back to the “master” list at any time to view all of the tasks shared between team members and the big picture of your project.\\n\\nTackle To Do Lists As a Winning Team\\n\\nWe encourage you and your team to dream big but keep the to-do list relevant and straight to the point. If you have too many things to look at, you will end up not knowing where to focus on. Same thing with your to-do list, if there are too many tasks laying around, you will get lost before you even start working on your list.\\n\\nYou can build in as many tasks as you want, your team members can also contribute to the task list and eventually create a big picture on how to achieve team goals. The brainstorming process can last forever until your team gets on the same page. However, when your team sits down at the desk and start working on the task list, you can use Quire Sublist to create a shorter version of the ever-growing list and focus on the tasks that matter to each individual only.\\n\\nTip: You can select the same tasks and create different sublists.\\n\\nThere are often some team members working together on the same section of the project. Quire Sublist was born to help you create a focused view for yourself and moreover, for the project members and even the external team that share the same workload. If you are a team manager, for example, you can select several crucial tasks related to the Phase 1 of the Product Development and create a sublist named Phase 1 then share with your team members. This way, everyone is kept on the same page and they all know which tasks are relevant to the milestone.\\n\\nThe key to productivity is to get focused on what should be done, instead of being worried about everything all over the place. With the combination of Quire MyTasks II and Sublist, now your team can be more proactive to stay on top of the deadlines.\\n\\nBe Ambitious but Stay Realistic with Your To Do List\\n\\nWhen Quire was born, we shared our philosophy to the world: every great dream needs a doable starting point. You can dream the world but without laying out the groundwork, you can never make your dreams come true. Quire is one of the few if not saying the first to allow users to create unlimited sublists within a master list. Productivity is all about getting focused on the right tasks at the right time. Nested task list, Kanban Board, Sublists are the powerful trio to help you visualize and accomplish your dreams.\\n\\nWe hope Quire Sublist can be a part of your successful stories, whether you are planning for your company trip or building a rocket. Helping you improve productivity, get things done and achieve your dreams is always our mission from day one. Share your stories with us on Twitter @quire_io or email us at feedback@quire.io.',\n",

              "   'As a writer, time is my most precious commodity.\\n\\nAnd as a writer who works full-time, who also happens to be the mother of a rambunctious two-year-old boy, this is especially true. But once time has run out, it’s gone. There is no going back in time to do things differently. It just keeps ticking forward, whether you want it to or not. When you’re drowning and you feel like there isn’t enough time to do all of the things you want to do, chances are, you’re probably right. Don’t let that beat you into submission.\\n\\nIf you’re like me, you have only the best intentions when you set out to do everything that needs to be done. You might wake up one morning feeling motivated, only to lose steam. You tell yourself your goals were too hard or that your expectations were unrealistic. How did you ever think you could get X, Y, and Z done today? So discouragement settles into your mind, and pretty soon, you’re paralyzed by inaction.\\n\\nSound familiar? I’ve been there.\\n\\nTo-do lists aren’t enough anymore. They’re nothing more than surface-level reminders of all the things staring you in the face. What to-do lists are missing is time. They’re missing the clear indication that tells you when you will work on something. Introducing: time blocking.\\n\\nTime Blocking 101\\n\\nTime blocking differs from to-do lists in that it allows you to visually break down your day or week, so you can figure out exactly how much unclaimed time you have to get shit done. By pulling up your calendar and filling out all of the big rocks — those activities that stay the same day after day (eating dinner, working, spending time at the gym, etc.) — you start to see where you have the flexibility to squeeze something in.\\n\\nTake a look at my actual weekly snapshot below.\\n\\nOn my calendar, I have myself getting up every day at 5:30am. For the next fifteen minutes, I make coffee, change my clothes, use the restroom — you get the picture. From 5:45am — 7:15am, I make time to write. Then, from 7:15am — 7:45am, I spend time with my son and get him ready for school. So on and so forth.\\n\\nIn doing this process, I found that color-coding different kinds of activities helped me quickly visualize my day. In my example, blue items represent time with my son, red items signal time spent for my job, and yellow signifies the time I was able to make for writing.\\n\\nTake a few minutes to sit down and fill out your calendar, starting with the routine activities that occur every day. This doesn’t have to be exact. In fact, at some point, something will pop up that completely throws off your morning. The goal here is to be 100% honest with yourself and to identify those gaps of time you didn’t realize you had. You’ll be surprised at the slots of time you discover.\\n\\nYour next step will be to prioritize your tasks. Remember, no matter how much you’d like to, you just cannot physically do everything. You’re a human being. Once you recognize and accept that, you’re ready to identify your priorities, and then you can start filling in those gaps on your calendar. You’re essentially ranking your to-do list items and taking the next critical step, which is to set aside a definitive time to do each item.\\n\\n6 things to remember when time blocking\\n\\nToo much time is better than too little. Always overestimate the time you think it will take to complete a task. If you get it done faster, great! The point is to give yourself some flexibility in case things don’t go as planned. Like a complete redo. Because it’ll happen. Have a security buffer. I like to figure in an additional 15 or 20 minutes when I time block. This covers things like bathroom breaks, interruptions, “getting in the zone,” and other random situations. You might be organized, but others are not. Be ready for anything. Block time for breaks. As I said, we’re human beings. It’s important to claim time for things like eating lunch, taking a walk, checking social media, etc. You can’t be 100% focused on completing tasks all day, every day. Give yourself some grace if you value your sanity. Downtime is worthy, too. I tend to be a workaholic, but that doesn’t mean I don’t value my downtime. It just means I get completely engrossed in what I’m doing. Block time for the finer things in life to avoid burnout. Binge watch Netflix. Go on a date. Have fun. Be transparent with people. It’s awesome that you’re putting all this time and effort into making the most of YOUR time. Know what’s even better? When others get on board, too! If you don’t communicate your schedule to others, don’t expect to actually stay on schedule. Fine-tune as you go. Time blocking is not a one and done kind of thing. As you get better at blocking out time and sticking to your schedule, you’ll uncover the rhythms that work best for you. Life happens. Old routines might fall off the calendar while new obligations get added on. The good thing is time blocking is fluid. Make it work for you.\\n\\nThere you have it. Time blocking is a fantastic and simple way to visualize your day and improve how you prioritize your life (YOU included!). By identifying your unclaimed time, you can proactively set aside time to do the important tasks that have been weighing you down. For me, that was making time to write. By getting up a little earlier and being disciplined and intentional with how I divvied up my time, I was able to find enough slots of time over a span of 3.5 months to finally get my first novel written. Wowzas!\\n\\nAnother cool thing? Through the process of time blocking, you will form new habits and routines that will help you accomplish whatever it is you need to accomplish — just like I did. It’s a good feeling when you can actually finish things and no longer feel like you’re drowning in the guilt of not finishing them. When you start making the most of the time you have, life becomes a little less overwhelming. And isn’t that what we all want?',\n",

Get MATLAB projects with source code for your learning and research.\\n\\nThis is a very often misunderstood concept. Here is the most important thing to understand: The communication SIGNAL is ANALOG, but the MODULATION is DIGITAL.\\n\\nWhy is the signal analog?\\n\\nA) Our world is analog. Signals are electromagnetic waves which are inherently analog. This can’t be changed.\\n\\n2. What is modulation and why do we need it?\\n\\nA) Modulation is embedding a message signal onto a CARRIER signal.\\n\\nB) In the early days, the ‘message’ was voice. If everyone is trying to transmit their signal, we couldn’t hear it due to interference with every other message…. like being in a crowded room with everyone talking at once and trying to listen to a conversation across the room.\\n\\nC) The ‘message’ is placed onto a CARRIER signal. The carrier is a signal (sinusoid) at a given frequency (channel) and the information is MODULATED onto the carrier. This keeps everyone’s signal from interfering if each conversation is on a separate channel.\\n\\n3. What is analog vs. digital modulation?\\n\\nA) Analog modulation was used first because it was easy. We had an analog signal and on the other end we wanted an analog signal. The most simplistic approach was to use AMPLITUDE MODULATION (AM). The voice message was used to change the amplitude of the carrier signal.\\n\\nB) Digital modulation uses BINARY format to change the PHASE or FREQUENCY of the carrier in discrete steps (1 or 0 as in the binary number representation). That is, the frequency of the carrier will be changed by +/- some small frequency offset based on the binary message. In reality the phase is modulated but frequency may be easier to visualize and is very close.\\n\\n4. Why is everything going to digital modulation over analog modulation?\\n\\nA) Digital modulation is more robust. If the signal is AM modulated, then any interference or noise is added directly to the signal… so it sounds like it has ‘static’ in it.\\n\\nB) Then systems went to FM instead of AM. FM = Frequency Modulation. This is still an analog modulation, but interference is far less likely to create frequency errors than amplitude errors. The FM signal can still sound like there is ‘static’ but not nearly as likely. That’s why FM sounds better than AM.\\n\\nC) Digital modulation only has to be accurate enough to decode the message into a 1 or 0. High or low. So, the digital modulation is extremely robust to noise and interference… but when it breaks, it is a brick wall. It sounds great until it breaks. This can be seen if you have watched an HDTV broadcast over the air. It looks awesome until the signal degrades (storm, bad antenna, etc.) and then you see large ‘pixelation’ and it flashes in and out completely as you begin to see the pixelation.',\n",

There are many things in life that one wants to do just for pleasure and fun and that’s it. These are the kind of desires that when completed gave him an eternal happiness that is just tremendous.

The 1st lecture was of about 6 mins and during my lecture I started writing it in order to remember it.\\n\\nGreeting in Korean Language\\n\\nAfter taking the first lecture, I just try to memorize it. The thing that I felt at that time was that nothing stops in that 6 mins. Everything was occurring usual. Then my mind just told me that ‘‘The biggest barrier was actually myself because it was all over me who was not doing anything through this whole time.’’ And one thing I also realize it’s about the priorities that one gave to specific things. It’s not the fault of the things that is happening in one’s life.\\n\\nThat’s how one start working on something.\\n\\nAfter it I believe on one thing and that was:\\n\\n‘‘Nobody can make you do something until you did not want to do it’’.\\n\\nAfter my first lecture then on Thursday I started my second lecture and it was also about 6–7 mins and I again memorized it and also revised my previous lecture as well.

But I still feel not enough until I changed my mindset. It was a whole new world to me!\\n\\nBefore, when I am struggling to finish some tasks, for example, to finish my case study of a product. All I am thinking is “me” I want to finish this because I have to finish it before the deadline. Otherwise, I’m in trouble. If I still can’t finish it, I will be frustrated and self-criticizing. But, if told me that I’m doing this to help people grow their design skills and save their time for not making the same mistakes. I suddenly become very motivated.\\n\\nHave a try of this kind of mindset:\\n\\nI’m doing ___ to help people ____ so they can ___\\n\\nI’m writing this article to help people don’t familiar with this industry to gain some general concept so they can have a better career choice. I’m sharing my thoughts of beating procrastination to help others are going through the same problem find a new solution that might boost their productivity.\\n\\nSounds quite different, right?\\n\\nWhen I add meaning to the things we are doing, it would sound more meaningful and important. That made me feel urgent, and I want to complete the mission as soon as possible without forcing myself.\\n\\n🌻 How I figure out this mindset?\\n\\nWhen I was working as a training assistant, I had learned a course about “influence.” Everyone can be an influencer, and we are doing it all the time, whether to influence our coworkers or family remembers, children, etc. But the influence is not always positive. So from then on, I have a mindset of making a positive influence on others.\\n\\nHave a try, and I hope it helps!',\n",

This means that, now, this stress disorder can be covered by health insurers and you no longer have to feel bad for needing to take time off to de-stress.\\n\\nThe term “burnout” originated in the 1970s by American psychologist, Herbert Freudenberger. It was used to detail the result of severe stress and high ideals in “helping” professions. A “helping” profession refers to jobs that involve sacrificing yourself for others such as doctors and nurses. These types of professions are inclined to leave people feeling exhausted and unable to cope, and feeling “burned out”.\\n\\nIt’s now not solely used for helping professions, but for anyone experiencing similar effects due to being overworked and overstressed at work.\\n\\nProductivity on a pedestal\\n\\nProductivity is the idea that you’re meant to be producing as many effective results as you can as quickly and efficiently as possible. And our society is obsessed with it.\\n\\nMany companies use productivity to measure employee efforts and business processes. There is a whole industry that provides tools, tips, and tricks that can help companies and individuals be as productive as possible. (And we can’t say that we’re not playing along with this).\\n\\nI get it, businesses want to be efficient. They want to get as much as they can with as few resources as possible. But placing productivity on a pedestal is what can pressure workers into taking on more projects, doing overtime, and working through their lunch breaks.\\n\\nA healthy work-life balance\\n\\nRegularly sacrificing break time is a sign that employees may be stretching their limits thin. They’re taking on too many extra tasks and projects simply because they’re afraid to say no and disappoint their bosses.\\n\\nA survey conducted by Tork revealed that millennials, who make up most of the US workforce, feel more pressured than their Gen X counterparts to not take their lunch breaks. 16% of them said they would take a pay cut of 10% so they could actually take a lunch break every day.\\n\\nThe idea that 16% of millennial workers aren’t taking their lunch breaks every day is (while not surprising) disheartening.\\n\\nBreaks are essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nThink of your brain like you would a muscle, the more you work it without a break, the quicker it will get exhausted. This can lead to reduced focus and diminished motivation.\\n\\nGoing without breaks can also result to added stress as you’re not getting the time to relax and recharge. Constantly working without a break can be very stressful, and too much stress can potentially lead to a work burnout.\\n\\nSo really, forgoing your breaks to do more work is counterproductive in the long run.\\n\\nBypassing burnouts with leisure time\\n\\nHaving a healthy work-life balance, while not the be all, end all solution, is a key element to avoid experiencing a work burnout.\\n\\nBy placing as much emphasis and importance on your free time as you do on your job can give you a sense of purpose outside of work and a different appreciation for life.\\n\\nI get it, work is important. We need it to pay bills, to not starve to death, and to have a roof over our heads. It also helps us to go on holidays, buy pretty clothes, and enjoy other luxuries. But it shouldn’t be your only reason for living. Even if you’re lucky enough to be doing your dream job, you need some kind of balance so that it stays that way and you don’t grow to resent it.\\n\\nThe importance of leisure time is mapped out in James Wallman’s book, Time and How to Spend It: The 7 Rules for Richer, Happier Days. It discusses how positive experiences can result in enduring, sustainable happiness and how spending your time in certain ways can lead to a more successful life.\\n\\nWallman himself notes that,\\n\\nIf you spend your time in certain ways, you’re more likely to be achieve the three things most of us want: happiness, resilience, and success. This is not only about how you spend your leisure time but how you spend all of your time.\\n\\nThe book provides a checklist that can be used as a framework for selecting activities that can help you avoid experiences that offer you no value. It is called the STORIES checklist and it stands for:\\n\\nStory\\n\\nTransformation\\n\\nOutside & Offline\\n\\nRelationships\\n\\nIntensity\\n\\nExtraordinary\\n\\nStatus & Significance\\n\\nEach element can help you figure out which experiences you should consider doing and how to make the most of not only your leisure time, but all of your time.',\n",

Unions increase the bargaining power of labour, which enables workers to negotiate a larger slice of the economic pie. In addition, coordinated wage bargaining can impede cost competition strategies and encourage productivity enhancing measures, thereby pushing the economy towards a high wage and high productivity equilibrium.\\n\\nNordic countries provide concrete examples of countries with high levels of collective bargaining alongside high levels of employment and productivity. Their ‘high-road’ model shows that collective bargaining is consistent with high levels of productivity and strong economic performance.\\n\\nSome key points:\\n\\n·1. Trade unions can influence both the labour share and the productivity channels, to the benefit of workers.\\n\\n·2. Competitiveness is consistent with a ‘high-road’ approach based on driving productivity, but also ‘low-road’ approachs based on driving wages and other costs downwards. Only the high-road approach is consistent with inclusive growth.\\n\\n·3. There is no clear relationship between collective bargaining and unemployment. Some of the best performing countries have strong union influence.\\n\\n·4. Empirical evidence suggests there may be small positive net effects of collective bargaining on productivity.\\n\\n5. Research finds that less prevalent trade unions and collective bargaining are associated with higher market inequality.\\n\\nThe latest NERI inBrief reviews some of the theory and evidence here.',\n",

I wanted to focus on achievable tactical things that would start to retrain my brain how to be without stimulation 24/7. I knew cutting it cold turkey was not an option because my job is somewhat reliant on my phone, but I needed to start somewhere. I also know that changing a habit is hard, especially one that’s tied to addictive behavior. I wanted some small quick wins. I also wanted it to be sustainable, not like a crash diet to lose 20 pounds in 2 weeks only to start eating normal again and gaining it all back in 2 days. With all that in mind, the following is what I’ve been doing to chip away at my addiction. Spoiler alert — my screen time has been down over 20% since January 1st!\\n\\nNot taking my phone into the bathroom. I know this is super gross but admit it, you do it too! I don’t have the excuse anymore that bathroom time is “escape” time from my kids. They are no longer of the age where they are all over me all the time. They don’t even try to barge in on me when I’m in the bathroom anymore. Bringing my phone into the bathroom just became a (pun intended) nasty habit. It was also a big waste of time.\\n\\nI know this is super gross but admit it, you do it too! I don’t have the excuse anymore that bathroom time is “escape” time from my kids.

Bringing my phone into the bathroom just became a (pun intended) nasty habit. It was also a big waste of time. Not looking at my phone between stop lights. The light would turn dark yellow and I’d already be reaching for my phone. God forbid one single solitary minute be spent just silently looking out the window. If I’m being really honest, I’m just not that important that anything needs to be responded to in the 1 minute available between stop lights. Not to mention I don’t hear “MOM, the light turned green…GO!” anymore. So that’s a win in and of itself. This goes for looking at my phone in traffic as well — that’s just flat out unsafe and sends a terrible message to my ALMOST driving daughter. Scary!\\n\\nThe light would turn dark yellow and I’d already be reaching for my phone. God forbid one single solitary minute be spent just silently looking out the window.

This goes for looking at my phone in traffic as well — that’s just flat out unsafe and sends a terrible message to my ALMOST driving daughter. Scary! Not plugging my phone in next to my bed. I always had excuses for this one which I’m sure you’ll relate to. The first excuse was “what if an emergency happens and I need to be reached?” “If my phone is plugged in somewhere else other than next to my bed I won’t hear it.” I found a way to get rid of that excuse and it’s called Emergency Bypass on iPhone. This allows certain contacts you designate to ring through even if you have Do Not Disturb mode on or vibrate mode on. That way I can put my phone in the bathroom and if something happens with my emergency contacts, I’ll still hear it ring. Check out how to set up Emergency Bypass here. Another excuse was “it’s my alarm clock so how will I wake up each morning?” For under $20 I can relive my teenage years and wake up to an actual old school alarm clock. This takes away the temptation to waste away in instagram land before I go to bed and drown in the twitterverse when I wake up.\\n\\nI always had excuses for this one which I’m sure you’ll relate to.

This is a tough one for me because I like to use all my precious time wisely. Was I really using my time wisely looking at ONE more thing on my phone waiting for a pot of water to boil? This really hit me when my daughter was doing homework at the kitchen counter and I was quite literally waiting for the water to boil for our pasta dinner. I was scrolling through who knows what on my phone and finally looked up and my daughter was like “geesh mom I was calling your name for like 5 minutes”. Now it was NOT 5 minutes but no doubt I was so deep into some junk on my phone that I tuned her out. To ween myself from this part of the addiction I got out a deck of cards and now play a game or twelve of solitaire. I’m also now have mad shuffling skill too — Vegas here I come!\\n\\nNot looking at my phone until my kids go to school. We have instituted a rule at our house that the kids are not to be on devices until they are 100% ready for school. 100% means if they have to leave at that very moment, they could walk out the door and be totally ready to go — breakfast eaten, shoes on, bag backed, water bottle filled, and teeth brushed. If ALL that is done they can look at their phone. I figured I better abide by this same rule, so I now leave my phone in the bathroom where it’s plugged in at night until they leave for school or I leave for carpool. Now we sometimes even have time for a game of 5 Crowns in the morning, I can actually throw in a load of laundry or do the dishes. What a concept!\\n\\nOf course there are always exceptions to each of these and I’m not perfect to say the least. But I am trying, and trying very hard. The kids are getting into it too. To start they are leaving their phones plugged in away from their beds. They really have NO excuse since I am their alarm clock! It’s the little things that often make the biggest difference and old habits die hard. It’s been about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say I feel calmer and more connected to my family. I am more present, less distracted and less daunted by downtime. Try it!',\n",

I made ShiftReader (a browser extension) to make it easy to train yourself in the most important speed reading methods, while you do your “daily” online reading. After training your speed reading skills with ShiftReader, you’ll be able to apply those same techniques to reading other things, like books and newspapers.\\n\\nSound awesome?Yes! I hear you say.\\n\\nHere are the fundamental ideas behind reading faster, and how the features of ShiftReader condition your brain and eyes to use those techniques.\\n\\nMove through text faster with a pacer\\n\\nWhen most people read, we either consciously or subconsciously re-read words that our eyes and brain have already perceived. This slows down our reading speed.\\n\\nWe can train our eyes to keep moving forward in text with the help of a pacer. The idea of a pacer is help our eyes move forward in text (and not re-read), at a consistent speed. Traditionally, pacing is done by pointing a pen or one’s finger at the text we’re reading, and then moving it forward.\\n\\nPacing is much more easy in ShiftReader. In ShiftReader, the pacer highlights each word (or each “chunk” of words, depending on your settings) that your eyes should focus on. Depending on the target words per minute (WPM) reading speed you specify, the pacer moves forward at that speed to guide your eyes forward.\\n\\nThis trains your eyes to consistently move forward in text, without needing to pick up a pen or point at the text with your finger.\\n\\nIf you want to push yourself to read faster, you can simply increase the target WPM in ShiftReader, and the pacer will advance at a faster speed.\\n\\nRead more words at a time by increasing your horizontal peripheral vision\\n\\nThe other major way to increase reading speed is to read more words at once.\\n\\nTo see how this works, you must first realize that when we read, our eyes actually “jump” around, instead of moving smoothly and in a straight line.\\n\\nTry this:\\n\\nClose an eye. Put your finger on top of that eyelid. Start reading some text. You’ll feel your eye making distinct movements or “jumping” from one group of words to the next.\\n\\nIn each of those jumps (or “saccades”), your eye and brain perceives a group of words. But each of those saccades takes time, a few fractions of a second: it’s not much but over a long article or book, those tiny pauses add up. What if you could train your brain to read more words, for every eye movement you make? Or in other words, what if you could increase and take advantage of your horizontal peripheral vision, to read more words at the same time?\\n\\nThat’s exactly what you train with ShiftReader. You can change (and ideally increase) the number of words (per “chunk”) that the pacer highlights. It might feel a little uncomfortable at first, but over time, you’ll find yourself increasing the number of words that you can read through your peripheral vision. And the more words you’re able to read per eye movement, the faster your reading speed.\\n\\nThose are the basics of using ShiftReader to train and develop your speed reading skills. There are many more ways ShiftReader can help: more guides coming soon.\\n\\nReady to become a faster reader? Download ShiftReader for free today',\n",

              "   'How is your year going?\\n\\nIf you made resolutions your answer will be pretty black or white. They’re either going well and you’re feeling light and powerful or they’re not going well and you’re feeling defeated and unhappy.\\n\\nIf you’ve listened to my podcast for a while you know I support choosing a word of the year instead of making resolutions.\\n\\nI have many reasons for this but the main one is resolutions do not foster positive feeling states which means they are not the path to positive change. I’m all about evolving to that next best level of ourselves. How do we do that? Focus on how we want to feel and get clear on the actions we need to take to get there. We do what we do so that we feel a certain way. If we say we want to lose 10 lbs, its because of how we think we’ll feel when we are 10 lbs lighter. If we want to make more money, it’s because of how we think we’ll feel when we are earning more. If we say we want to yell less, it’s because of how we’ll feel when we are yelling less. This is why choosing a word of the year is magical. It focuses on our desired feeling state. We don’t limit ourselves to the results (less weight, less yelling, etc…\\n\\nThe first year I chose a word of the year I chose the word JOY. I wrote the word on stickies all around my house and got a bracelet that said the word to remind me of my intention during the day. When a decision came up, I measured the two options against my desired feeling state of joy. Would writing that one more email or sitting next to my son bring me joy? Do that. Would finishing my blog or watching Netflix bring me joy? Do that. Would eating that brownie or going for a walk bring me joy? Do that. In focusing on how I wanted to feel and how I wanted my year to go, I let go of the perfectionism of my past and the black and white framework resolutions set up.\\n\\nWe are not here on earth to be perfect. Humans are fallible. Our journey here is to make mistakes, learn from them, and then do it all again. Click To Tweet\\n\\nThat first year of choosing a word of the year turned out to be the most joyful year of my life because of the small steps I took every day to choose my desired feeling state. Does that mean every day was joyful? No. But each moment of each day, I had the choice to choose joy again. Contrast that against If I had had a resolution to only do things that brought me joy and I missed a day, I would’ve felt disappointed in myself and critical of my actions….Oh warriors, If you’re anything like me, you’ve spent enough of your life judging and criticizing yourself. Life is difficult. We make mistakes. Choose to set yourself up for success.\\n\\nA Kinder Way\\n\\nAs I’ve aged, I have come to discover a more accepting and peaceful way to live life. I like to think of it as the difference between looking at my actions as either a critic or a detective of myself. Am I criticizing myself or looking at my actions through a kind and curious lens?\\n\\nThe further I move from judgement of myself and my actions, the better I feel. I don’t need to be my worst critic. People are going to criticize me. I don’t have to be one of them. The more curious I can get about myself and my actions, from the standpoint of a kind observer, the better for all. For me, for my family, for my community.\\n\\nLife is an Education\\n\\nLife is all about learning about ourselves. Learning why we do what we do. Learning about what pisses us off and why. Learning about what excites us and why. There is no one else like you on this planet. When we open our minds to learning from our experiences instead of judging ourselves for them, magical things happen. This is the difference between making resolutions and choosing a word of the year.\\n\\nIt’s a Choice\\n\\nWherever you are on your path, why not choose to make this a day, a week, a year to feel good about yourself? Choose to be your biggest supporter. Choose to view your mistakes as part of the process. Choose to enjoy the learning experiences. Choose to support yourself. Choose to enjoy the practicing, the daily tasks, the little things. Choose to view your days as step stones to a greater journey, not lessons of how you never do what you say you’ll do; not as reinforcement as to why nothing works for you. Our brain looks for what we train it to look for. If you want something different, do something differently If you want to feel differently, focus on different thoughts. Don’t allow those toxic thoughts in. Choose to be curious. Choose to learn. Move away from self judgement. Choose to be your best supporter.\\n\\nIf you’re having a hard time with your relationship with yourself please make sure you subscribe to my podcast and that you get my weekly newsletter. I offer multiple free resources in addition to paid programs throughout the year where I can help you with this. I will help you become your best cheerleader. To see yourself through my eyes and how I see you. To imagine a future unlike your current reality. To challenge your brain to make new patterns and habits that support you on your learning journey here on earth.\\n\\nToday is Your Day.\\n\\nThis is your moment. At any moment of any day in any month of any year you can start again. Choose to be your best supporter. You are the only you on earth. You matter to me. Now matter to you.\\n\\nGo get it warrior.',\n",

While some people get jobs immediately after leaving the university through connections or by merit, others settle to do just any jobs they can lay hands on just to get by while they wait to move on to something better. The rest may never work, some sit at home, others try their hands on new things; petty business or menial jobs. The Nigerian unemployment rate was at about 23.11 percent in 2019, according to reports projected to reach 33.5 percent in 2020. This is for some reasons we have the yearly influx of fresh graduates into the labour market and workers laid off from their jobs just to name 2 factors.\\n\\nWorking in an organization, be it an office, a factory etc can sometimes be as challenging as looking for a new one.\\n\\nSo how to keep jobs has become a very important question, people seek ways to keep their place in the office, nobody wants to go home, everyone wants to be in their bosses’ good book so people do all sort of things to keep their place, there is sabotage, there is animosity, betrayals, friends turn to foes bridges are burnt, gossips, office politics just all manners of sad stories. But are all these necessary for one to keep their place in an organization?\\n\\nWell, in my few years of working the white-collar job, I have had some experiences, the good the bad and the ugly, I have also seen people who keep and even ascend in the office by doing things differently. So I want to share a few tips on how you can do things differently to be relevant and keep your place secured at work.\\n\\nKnow your job. Everybody who comes into an organization comes in to fill a particular need. It is always about doing something. No employer will recruit personnel just because he or she likes the person. You are employed to solve a particular problem. Find out what problem you are employed to solve, know about that problem, solve the problem. Provide solutions; yeah you have identified your primary job in the organisation so that’s all you are going to do, I will just come to work, do my job and that’s all, that is what they are paying me for, I Can not do more than my paycheck, hell if you want to keep your job when or if things get uncertain as it is now in this pandemic season, then your job does not end there, you can find new ways to do your job, find out easier ways to do your job, be innovative, be resourceful, use your head. Always try to find out new ways to do old things, always do more than they pay you for. Be a team player, no man is an island, especially in Nigeria, it is very difficult to do anything alone. It is not different in the office setting, people are there to help you and it will also be great for you to do the same for others. Do not see your colleagues as competition, avoid the too know sickness, be yourself, help people. At my former workplace, I had a colleague who usually made reports every day and each time she made the reports two out of every six reports she submitted to her superiors, there was always an error in the calculations she did. She had been working like that for over a year until about a month after I started working with her in the office. I pointed out that she could use the office excel to create a template and put in the formulas, this way she will have excel do all the calculations for her. I created the template for her and until I left the place, she used the template I created. There were no more errors in her reports. It was a simple idea and you can imagine how much it helped her work. She no longer got queries from her superior for the constant errors in her work. It also created a reliance on me because my colleagues always came to ask for suggestions on how to make their work easier for them. Be a purple cow. When I read this book by Seth Godin, it talked about how to transform businesses by being remarkable. The same applies to persons who desire to be remarkable and indispensable in their organisation. Train yourself to be remarkable. People always expect their organizations to enrol or put them through training, which is a great idea, so Even though a few companies might do that for their staff, many other organizations will not do that. They would rather employ people who have gone through required training at the expense of the staff who is waiting to be sponsored for training. There are so many training one can enrol for depending on the relationship to your field; ACCA, ICAN, HSE, coding, public speaking, creative writing, Excel, PowerPoint presentation. Notice that these training can be done online from your home, and they do not require a bachelor in any specific majors. so after work instead of going home to Netflix, you can fuel all that energy into more productive tasks that are self-development. Find out relevant skills or certifications that will be necessary for your work, that will aid your promotion and start taking classes. The best time to start classes is NOW. the best investment you can make is in yourself the words of Warren Buffet. A positive mindset, staying in a job has a lot to do with your state of mind, the vibes you give out. When you are always negative, it sends the wrong message. Things go wrong. Always stay positive. Hygiene, have you ever come close to a waste bin, how bad does it feel to have one nearby? The moment you get into a room and perceive something foul, natural instinct is to find where the smell is coming from and get rid of it immediately. I can say the same of some people. At first, I really did not want to comment about this but honestly, people have lost jobs because of poor hygiene The reason people will not keep proper body hygiene is still not clear to me, like bro, this is your body, love it before another person can want to love you. Be it bad breath or oozing body odour or dirty clothes, nobody I mean nobody wants to be around these elements and no boss wants to have such persons around, they will find any slightest reasons to fire such staff. So looking good is very crucial. Looking good, differs from being expensive. Clean well ironed and fitting clothes, wear a perfume, brush your teeth properly, please I beg you to get an antiperspirant deodorant, this is the most affordable thing every person a man or woman should have in their closet.\\n\\nI am sure you might have drawn some conclusions based on the suggestions given above, take the relevant points from here to make up for the deficits to ensure we keep our jobs after the pandemic\\n\\nI hope everyone makes it through these rough times, keep safe, wash hands with soap and water regularly and stay at home.',\n",

              "   'Minimalism has been one of the hottest trends over the last couple of years. Everything from fashion to home furniture, and wine labels are now minimalistic. Seeing as working form home is becoming at least a temporary norm, it is only fitting that there should be a minimalist’s guide for it. Below are the bare essentials you need to work remotely like a minimalist.\\n\\n1. Have a Smartphone\\n\\nYour phone is possibly one of the most important things you need to work remotely. When you add Lark’s mobile friendliness to the mix, like our Magic Share feature which automatically adjusts documents shared during video calls for optimal mobile viewing, it becomes apparent that all you really need is your phone.\\n\\nAnd…that’s it. A smartphone is really all you need to work remotely with complete minimalism. But, here are 3 other practical things you can try out when working remotely which won’t fully compromise your minimalism.\\n\\n2. Sound Isolating Headphones\\n\\nWhen working remotely, it is worth investing in a good pair of headphones that not only block out noise for you to hear incoming voices, but also dampens the sound around your mic so your colleagues can hear better if you are outside, or in a crowded spot like a coffee shop. Aside from calls, colleagues may choose to send voice messages instead, especially when they’re on the go.\\n\\n3. An Upgraded Calendar\\n\\nThe ideal calendar allows you to see multiple schedules in one place. This is incredibly important when you’re working remotely because the boundary between work and personal life can be blurry. Tasks like doing the dishes, or grabbing groceries can now potentially bleed into the day’s schedule, sandwiched between a 2pm video conference and a 5pm deadline.\\n\\nA calendar that can hide your private schedule from teammates while allowing them to see a public schedule with all your work related activities can add clarity to your daily life. Not only does Lark’s calendar do just that, but it also allows you to add different time zones to the calendar so you’re able to check the time of global teams with one click.\\n\\n4. A Notebook\\n\\nTaking notes with your hand is processed differently in your brain than when you are typing, especially when performing creative work. Your hands command more fluidity over the pen than they do over keys. Why not consider taking a notebook with you when working remotely, and try keeping most of the outlining and brainstorming on paper rather than on screen. You’ll hopefully find a different flow to your thought process, not to mention some needed respite for your eyes away from the screen as well.\\n\\nGo one step further and turn on the “Do Not Disturb” mode in Lark so you won’t get bothered by work notifications either and can focus purely at the task on hand.',\n",

              "   'Getting Started\\n\\nIt is important if you’re going to getting anything done, especially your most demanding tasks, that you take a moment before you start to get in the right frame of mind. Personally I find it very helpful to meditate for at least ten minutes just to prime my mind for the task I’m about to get into. Occasionally I might also call to memory some things I am grateful for like my family or my health to keep me in a positive place, I find this helps quite a bit. The steps may be different for you, but I advise you to take the time to get yourself in the right headspace before you begin. Your outcome will benefit for you going into the task ready to do your best. You could even use the time just before you start to inform those around you that you’ll be needing some time to focus and that you’d appreciate it if they left you uninterrupted for as much time as you think you might need. Let’s go through the process.\\n\\nDefine the Point of what you want to do.\\n\\nOnce you’re ready to start working on your task, sit down and figure out exactly what it is you’d like to accomplish, when you have a goal in mind, write it down. You can refer to it as your Point. It is important that you write it down, that way you can always refer back to it for clarity or use it to assess how well your actions went to meeting your goal. Keep it specific but very simple, the less clutter you have to deal with, the more efficiently you’ll move towards your goal.\\n\\nIf there are many objectives, figure out the one that has the greatest influence on your overall purpose being achieved. You might want to get a lot done, but of all the objectives there will be one, which when accomplished will get you furthest towards your overall goal. Attempting to focus on, or do everything all at once, is a sure way of getting very little done, if anything at all. Split focus is no focus, you’ll be better served getting through one task and then moving on to the next than attempting to do many things all at once. If you doubt this, it might benefit you to pick up The One Thing by Gary Keller. Reduce everything down to your primary objective and move onto the next step in the process\\n\\nPhoto by Retha Ferguson from Pexels\\n\\n2. Get A Plan Together\\n\\nThe next step in the process is to get a Plan together for your Primary Objective. Take note of everything you will have to do in order to get the objective accomplished. Again, you want everything written so that come action time you’re not constantly wondering if you’ve forgotten to include something or you’re doing too much. Doing the due diligence now will minimize distractions as you move towards your goal. Be as specific as you need to be, within reason of course, if you feel something is imperative to the task, include it. At the end of the planning process you should have written down all the activities you believe will need to be done in order to get the job done. When you’re satisfied you have everything, move onto the next step. You’re a little closer to getting done.\\n\\n3. Set your Priorities\\n\\nWith the second step done, your third step is to objectively consider every aspect of your plan and Prioritize. All the steps in your plan will probably be of some importance but they certainly won’t all be of equal importance, as such the point of the third step is to identify those activities in your plan that carry the most weight. Again it’s important that you write out your revised plan, this time in order of priority, beginning with your high value activities. Ordering your activities in terms of their importance in relation to the main objective will keep you from falling into the ‘busyness’ trap. If you’re going to get things done, it is important that your efforts and your energy be spent on what will benefit you the most. Getting caught up being ‘busy’ doing some random thing of little importance will hurt your progress, and we don’t want that. Some activities might appear important but if you consider things deeply, you’ll find they actually have little bearing on whether the job’s been done at the end of the day. Setting your priorities before you get to working will allow you to weed out the needless tasks and get you focused on the important ones\\n\\nImage created using Canva\\n\\n4. Get to Doing — Produce Results\\n\\nFinally, with your priorities straight, you can move onto the fourth and final step, Producing results. At this stage in the process you actually begin to do things. You’ll be working with the added benefit of knowing you actions won’t just be getting things done for the sake of it, you’ll be performing high value tasks that’ll help you achieve your goal as efficiently as possible. The steps are designed so that if you stick with them up to this point you’ll be able to go through your list of activities operating at peak productivity. You’ll be able to go about your business firmly convinced you’re on the right path. With every task you get done, you’ll feel yourself getting closer to your objective and your motivation will constantly be on the up. Stick at it long enough and you’ll find you’ve got to your objective in next to no time and a lot more efficiently than if you’d just rushed into action under the pressure of wanting to get something done.\\n\\nI hope you see the benefit in choosing to go about your work using the four steps laid out above. They will really help you get the most out of your effort and time, and now more than ever it is important that we use both our time and our effort as wisely as possible.\\n\\nHere’s a quick break down of the steps just so you can use them better as you go about your work. One more time, the 4 P’s to get you through your task better and easier.\\n\\nPoint — if you’re going to do anything, it is best you consider why and what you want to achieve. It will save you getting halfway into things only to find your aim was misplaced. Know exactly what you hope to have achieved at the end of the process before you begin.\\n\\nPlan — once you figured what it is you want to do, identify how you’ll go about it and what activities are required. Knowing how you intend to get done will save you pouring your useful time and energy into activities that won’t help.\\n\\nPrioritize — a plan is great, one in order of priority is better. Identifying your high value activities will allow you to focus your energies on the most rewarding activities in relation to your goal.\\n\\nProduce — once you have a clear picture of you priorities, you can get to doing the activities you know and trust will be crucial in getting you to your objectives without the nagging feeling you should be doing something else instead.\\n\\nAnd that’s that, The 4 P’s that will help you get whatever you must do, done more efficiently.\\n\\nJust 2 more P’s for your benefit, you’ll surely love this.\\n\\nIntroducing The Pareto Principle, the 80/20 rule.\\n\\nSimply put the Pareto Principle tells us that the bulk of results are typically generated from very little of what we actually do. The idea is that about 80% of you output is usually drawn from about 20% of your input.\\n\\nThat should be some welcome news, I imagine.\\n\\nNow you can get to working on whatever you choose to do knowing that by simply producing at least 20% of you expected workload, you could clear up 80% of the total task.\\n\\nThink about it, if you plan and prioritize properly, simply by performing one of your high value activities you’ll have gone a great way towards accomplishing your goal and with every other high value task you get done the closer you’ll be to MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.\\n\\nWork with all that in mind and you’ll start to get some of your productivity back and not before long, you’ll have built up a head of steam and you’ll be getting through your tasks a lot faster than you were going before you were forced out of your rhythm.\\n\\nThe simple process above is designed to help you keep up with whatever you must, allowing you more time for the things you love and a lot less stress to contend with.',\n",

              "   'A professional Public Relations campaign is a highly effective means to showcase the positive aspects of your person or business. Employing the right PR strategies can also enhance credibility by helping to establish a set of industry standards.\\n\\nAnthony Galanda is a Public Relations Specialist from New York and has worked in various roles pertaining to the PR landscape. Having grown up in New York, he is well versed in effective communication with diverse populations and understands the growing need for PR in today’s digital world. He takes the time to outline the various advantages of professional PR services.\\n\\nWhat is Public Relations?\\n\\nPublic relations professionals work to shape an individual or organization’s image, helping to manage the release of information, and mitigate the effect of negative publicity. Through effective communication, they are the medium between the public and the organization they represent.\\n\\nAnthony Galanda explains that businesses and individuals are increasingly utilizing PR personnel as a marketing technique, helping to build a solid foundation from the ground up. While most marketing is now done online, PR professionals cover a wide range of responsibilities which include: analyzing and interpreting public opinions, developing strategies to increase brand recognition, creating web content (such as websites, blogs, social media posts), and working as a liaison between the company and the press.\\n\\nPublic relations specialists also help to proactively prepare for a crisis, and in the event of negative press, work diligently to regain customer trust.\\n\\nDigital PR\\n\\nAn essential aspect of online marketing is maintaining a positive web presence. Anthony claims that this is achieved by posting to social media platforms, putting out relevant and newsworthy content, and continuously monitoring the internet for consumer trends.\\n\\nAlmost all businesses have a Facebook page, Instagram, or Twitter account and PR helps provide content and advertisements on each. Through these platforms, companies are now more accessible to both their customers and the public, providing important updates on promotions, new product launches, and campaigns.\\n\\nPR representatives also help look out for possible collaborations, such as through YouTube channels, and online influencers says Anthony Galanda, helping a business spread their message to their target audience.\\n\\nBusiness Values\\n\\nPR constructs the vision of what a business is in the eyes of the public, helping portray their core values and beliefs. Through their online presence, the public can view how they operate, and what their business model is, says Anthony Galanda. Customers take note of these aspects and can then make an educated decision on whether or not to do business with them.\\n\\nAdditionally, while individuals are free to speak their minds, sometimes false statements or claims can paint businesses in a negative light. PR works hard to rectify these types of situations, working with the customer to see what can be changed and/or provided to help increase their trust and patronage with the business. For larger-scale crisis’, PR can help run campaigns to increase brand awareness, helping positively portray a business.\\n\\nCrisis Management\\n\\nIn the past few weeks, the U.S. has gone into lock down due to COVID-19. This pandemic has proven to effectively devastate the global economy, and many businesses are feeling its effects. It is during a time like this that PR is stepping up and showing the public exactly what the organizations they represent truly stand for.\\n\\nRestaurants, manufacturers, and small businesses alike are all banding together to provide whatever they can to the public. A stark contrast is being seen from pure-profit marketing just a few weeks ago, to companies running television ads standing in solidarity with healthcare workers and urging people to stay home to avoid spreading COVID-19. Businesses are offering their products and services at a reduced cost, or free of charge to those in need, while industries are deferring payments, or helping provide payment relief.\\n\\nPR is playing a significant role in providing the public with the information and support they need from their businesses. In the coming months, consumers will be more prone to support the businesses that stood up and helped during this pandemic.',\n",

              "   'Part One\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I spoke with an old colleague. He asked me, “how are you doing?” Being playfully honest by nature, I told him things were not so good that day. He didn’t know what to do with my response.\\n\\nWe ask the common “how are you doing?” many times a day without any real thought. In a lot of ways, it’s the same as asking a child “how was school?” If you’re a parent, you know that, almost always, “school was fine.” It’s only until you ask “anything happened during lunch today?” or “what do you think of your biology teacher?” that you really start getting somewhere.\\n\\nThe same is true in the life of a colleague. Asking the common question is deceptively loaded and you’re likely to get the same response over and over again. When you’re there with the person, you can intuit a lot from their body language. But, in virtual interaction, social exploration is painful.\\n\\nWhat I’ve found is that, in this new mode of work, it is awkward to maintain and cultivate deep, personal bonds. We are less likely to have a sense of belonging and fulfillment, which challenges our motivation and productivity. How do we organically create and retain bonds between our colleagues? What, and where, is the virtual water cooler?\\n\\nDiscovering the power of open-ended questions has been my life’s work. Advising leaders on how to be the best version of themselves. How to signal a culture-driven mindset that effectively permeates across the enterprise and inspires people to thrive. How to equip anyone with the secrets of social bonding.\\n\\nSHARE HARDSHIP\\n\\nCommunicating how we’re dealing with difficulties is a good way to set the stage for real-talk. A newly hired member of my team likes to open the Monday conversation by asking what we’ve been cooking over the weekend. We are all having to cook way more these days, but there can be joy in it.\\n\\nI share a first attempt at focaccia that failed to rise. An easy slow-roasted Japanese sweet potato recipe. Adding turmeric to my spice cabinet (and you can tell so much about someone from their spice cabinet). Today, I learned that he’s going to be fasting for the coming month, so I guess we won’t be talking about food for a while!\\n\\nSET SIGNAL\\n\\nEvery week, I ask my team what is so hard about working remotely, and we spend time finding solutions. After four weeks of crisis talk, it’s no longer enough to ask about the well-being of people around you. It is now time to find ways to optimize this shared experience.\\n\\nThe best way to show open-minded interest in virtual interactions is, first, by showing your face (which should be the new etiquette of virtual meetings!). It’s hard enough to keep the bonds with colleagues you know, but there’s an underlying urgency about finding ways to form new bonds with new people. We forget that we’re making micro-decisions about the people we’re interacting with based more on what we see than what we hear.\\n\\nLEAVE EXPECTATIONS BEHIND\\n\\nWe need to get past generic interaction to get to the good stuff. By signaling to your colleagues that “how are you doing?” is not just an opener, they become more willing to share what really matters to them. Personal bonding is the unspoken foundation of productivity. But, counterintuitively, true bonding happens when the conversation transcends role and agenda, just like it does around the water cooler.',\n",

              "   'Imagine using a thousand-plus page college textbook without an index. You’d waste countless minutes searching for the correct chapter while you could have been studying for that impending final. You wouldn’t mind having no index for a hundred page book but that index would come in really handy for your gigantic college textbook. This same concept can be applied to databases and there indexes or lack thereof.\\n\\nWhat are Indexes?\\n\\nIndexes are essentially data structures used to make querying databases faster. An index can be a column on the actual table or another table in itself. They contain keys which have pointers that point to a row on the table. A good way to think about an index is to think about an index in a book. A book can be thought of as the table and at the back of the book you have an index which tells you where you can find information on specific words through out the book. The index is sorted alphabetically, so rather than scanning the whole book to find a word, all you have to do is go to the index, find the word which is sorted alphabetically and it contains all pages you can find this word.\\n\\nSearching through a non-indexed data table would require looping through each row.\\n\\nWhy use Indexes?\\n\\nAs illustrated in the above picture, searching through a non-indexed database would entail looping through every row to find the target data. This linear time complexity can quickly become an issue as the database grows. Luckily indexes can cut that search time to logarithmic time. However, there are a few disadvantages to indexing. Some indexes require additional disk space. Also, even though indexes help locate data while updating and deleting, they can actually require more processing time if multiple index data structures need to be updated. You’ll also need more memory space allocated for the index and its references.\\n\\nAn index eliminates the need for looping through the entire table.\\n\\nHow do Indexes work?\\n\\nIndexing a database sorts the data into a B-tree structure. B-trees are self balancing trees that are similar to binary tree searches. NOTE: B-trees are NOT binary trees. Each node in a binary tree can have up to two child nodes while B-tree nodes can have any number of children. This makes a B-tree structure much more conducive to storing data. Best of all, all actions in a B-tree are done in logarithmic time.\\n\\nB-tree nodes can have any number of children nodes while binary trees can only have one or two children.\\n\\nA B-tree structure is made up of root, branch, and leaf nodes. Root node entries correspond to the highest branch node entries, and the highest branch node entries correspond to the highest leaf node entries. The leaf node entries contain pointers to the rows of data that have that value. The size of the node correspond to the size of a disc block and the depth of tree is the logarithmic function of the node size and the # entries.\\n\\nB-tree structure\\n\\nAs seen below, traversing a B-tree is very efficient. It starts at the root node and moves in ascending order until it finds a value greater than or equal to itself. It then follows that node to the next node and so forth until it finds the value it is looking for with pointers to the rows of data that will be returned.\\n\\nTraversing a B-tree\\n\\nIn Summation\\n\\nLike nearly everything programming, indexing a database comes with a trade-off. Indexing makes searching and retrieving data from a database faster at the cost of more memory space allocation and extra maintenance. In essence, as the size of the database grows, the need for an index increases.',\n",

This wasn´t my first brush-up with coding, when I was in engineering school I took a basic java course which I passed with average grades and without taking much from it.Later in the degree I took a course on numerical modelation and analysis that required some implementations on matlab and VBA to complete. I scored better marks, good enough to win a TA position, but that was the end of my programming expertise.\\n\\nI graduated , pursued advanced degrees and then join the workforce as an engineer. This was the time when the mobile market became ubiquitous and smartphones became a universal tool. It was the rise of the app.\\n\\nSince I´ve always been drawn to technology , I eagerly became an android user , and quickly adopted the smartphone as part of my life.Still, I could only helped to watch longingly to the tech world , and all its promises, wishing I could take part on a development team and creating apps , videogames and participating on exciting advances of technology. Alas, my engineering degree , work experience and specializations had nothing to do with the tech world and my lackluster performance on the subject while in college discouraged me on seeking out deeper knowledge in computer science and software engineering. I tried several times to start studies in tech and dabbled in video game design , but because of a lack of focus and organization I usually gave up after a couple of weeks.\\n\\nLast year though , was different, last year I decided that I needed to try and learn to code for real , because I could not just watch my life pass by me , content with what I have achieved so far and not trying to learn something that really intrigued me. Thus , I picked up a python course in CodeCademy, after a weekend I was done but I found that I pleasantly wanted more. I downloaded several books and for almost a year I have been practicing algorithms , data structures and some simple applications. Eventually I realized that I like this stuff , and that I want to learn more about it. Finally , I downloaded Android Studio and started to work on simple apps. It is now my desire to become a fully fledged Android developer and I will share my journey here , hoping to find like minded peers and share my passion with the community.

Because, fortunately, my father owns a store that mainly sells diverse gizmos and etcetera. Behind that prototypical water lock, is my extreme exposure on mechanizing and reverse-engineering hardware and software, which is greatly influenced by my father also.\\n\\nMy father brought me to the world of coding by making me take lessons online when I was still 13. It was a whole new world to me – “Hello World,” as they introduce new coders. I persevered through it, though it involved lots of logic; you name it: Complex conditionalities and high-order functions integrated, It has its wild jargons.\\n\\nAlso, he oriented me about making a decent profession out of it. I could earn double the maximum wage while working at home – that part blew me. But it’s not just about money, I’ve always believed that decisions are to be made out of something that are greater than just for ourselves. Knowing that technology is rising, and will be the future jobs, I want to be a part of it.\\n\\nFrom there, I just knew what path to take on, and for the first time, I took a firm step to choosing my destiny.\\n\\nCompared to what I was passionate about, I have also thought of taking Humanities and Social Sciences into account. I am passionate about creative writing, and I have a keen attitude towards music, poetry, artfulness, and want of defining the meaning of life – which is philosophy and politics.\\n\\nHowever, I didn’t take it. Because I have a strong belief that someday, the world has its ways of teaching me those. It is possible to learn everything through time investment. Also, I had a principle to hold on: “make ‘what you’re good at’ your passion,” So I held to it.\\n\\nFrom that day until now, I still have sensible delusions of authoring a book while being a software engineer, which wouldn’t turn out to be impossible.\\n\\nI have known some programmer authors that write best-selling books like Ms. Marie Lu and who knows who else. That is why I have no reason to be worried about the path I took. Alternatively, I can be like Elon Musk, he has many different biographers – I can be cool with that.\\n\\nI’ve had the ‘HUMMS or STEM’ dilemma already since I was Grade 10. I have reflected on what strand I would take the whole year, and I’ve found reasonable events of why I should take STEM: My father’s legacy, my skills, great profession, and serving a purpose for the community.\\n\\nDespite all of it, one thing is I know for sure, I want to inspire people through writing and being an external force to the technological world. However, practically, I wouldn’t need to be worried that much about my strand, as long as I made a difference in this world, or have made it better than before I was here, my life is going to be worth living.',\n",

So its working will like this — suppose we have a list (li = [34, 63, 98]), it will compare first element (34 in this case) with the max value (we define max = 0) and if element value is greater than max value, then it will assign the first element to max value, and this continues till the last element of list.\\n\\n# assign max to zero\\n\\nmax = 0 for i in range(n): # if value at index is greater than max\\n\\nif li[i] > max: # assign that element value to maximum\\n\\nmax = li[i] # print the largest value\\n\\nprint(\"Largest value is: \", max)\\n\\nCombined Code\\n\\nn = int(input(\\'Number of input\\')) li = [] for i in range(n): b = int(input(\"List value are: \")) li.append(b) print(li) max = 0 for i in range(n): if li[i] > max: max = li[i] print(\"Largest value is: \", max)\\n\\nIf you find any mistake.

Someone has got to finally say what many of us as experienced software engineers have been thinking for some time now.\\n\\nI’ve been a developer for over 20 years working for some of North America’s most prestigious companies. For several years now I’ve been watching the state of UI and how it’s gone from bad to worse. Specifically, I’m talking about “fad-tech”, those cutesy not-so-little pieces of JS and CSS that are supposed to be all the rage with the newbie crowd and now even with some seasoned engineers who should know better.\\n\\nThe snowballing culture of using these frameworks, like Angular, have avalanched us into code hell with no end in sight of when this nonsense is ever going to level off.\\n\\nEveryday I see job postings come into my email, companies of all sizes scrambling for EXPERIENCED Angular 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 developers with at least 5 years of experience building and maintaining this mess we call “state-of-the-art” UI.\\n\\nIt’s not “state-of-the-art”. It’s a mess.\\n\\nSeveral years ago I had an interview with EA (Electronic Arts) during which I was told that the company was junking all of their UI frameworks and returning to simply writing plain vanilla ECMA (JavaScript) enclosures. (That would be JS “plugins” for us jQuery people.) I was surprised but also curious.\\n\\nNow the rest of us know why.\\n\\nKeep It Stupid-Simple\\n\\nI don’t like calling people “stupid”, so I’ve sort of rearranged the classic KISS acronym. But the KISS principle has been utterly lost with the latest versions of Angular. It’s no longer just a UI framework, but a backend service as well. Your UI people are now having to write backend code that goes beyond mere HTML templating. Some people would like to say that is a good thing! But it’s not.\\n\\nYes, Angular has some cool “whiz-bang” features—ALL of which are completely unnecessary to write effective and stunning UI or deliver a professional UX.\\n\\nSPA’s (single-page applications) are out. They are difficult to maintain and wreak havoc with analytics and search engine crawlers which rely on the URL actually changing.\\n\\nYes, there are work arounds for these issues, but THAT’S THE POINT! You shouldn’t have to write code to “work around” how the web actually works!\\n\\nJust Say No to UI Compilers\\n\\nAnother “fad-tech” that’s been around a while that also needs to go is Sass and Less. Honestly, I like the code organization that these CSS frameworks offer. What I don’t like are “mixins” and that they need to be compiled to run.\\n\\nAt this point, I don’t know why browsers don’t just natively support SCSS as a standard way to ingest CSS code, but that’s a topic for another time.\\n\\nThe bottom line with these CSS pseudo-languages is that they really don’t save time; they’re not easier to use and learn; and at the end of the day, all they really do is generate nice clean well-targeted CSS code that all of us should be writing natively anyway.\\n\\nIf you want to use Sass or Less and pre-compile them in your own dev environment, I don’t have a problem with that. But what we should never see are these files entering the CICD pipeline for compiling during deployments.\\n\\nThe same goes for any other JavaScript library or framework that eventually compiles to plain vanilla ECMA as well.\\n\\nEvery step you add to the CICD pipeline just gums up and bloats what should be a very simple deployment process. We should be looking for ways to decrease the number of steps in the process, not pile on more just because “Jenkins” allows us to do it.\\n\\nAngular is Bloating the UI\\n\\nCall me a UI purist, but the current state of UI is not “art”—it’s a cluster-(expletive omitted). I get that people at Google are bored and need something to do, but Angular and other similar frameworks are destroying the simplicity of the UI, not making it easier.\\n\\nThe point is you don’t need a bloated framework to write clean, elegant UI or build an effective UX. You can use whatever native templating engine your backend provides without bloating the frontend with incomprehensible and un-debuggable compiled JS.\\n\\nAngular is Costing Companies Billions\\n\\nAt the end of the day, a framework is supposed to make coding easier, not harder. It’s supposed to save companies money with that ease of use, not cost them more.\\n\\nBut this is exactly what is happening—Angular is expensive to run.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Angular (and other UI frameworks as well) cost companies more money, lots of money, to train and re-train employees to learn and re-learn a framework that keeps changing versions every year or so. Yes, Angular has now promised that all new versions will be backward compatible, but again, that is just going to add to the already bloated complexity when the next new “really cool” component needs to change everything again.\\n\\nAnd God help you if you’re a contractor who works with several enterprises who are all using different UI frameworks. You now need to learn and know not just 12 different flavors of Angular, but various versions of Vue and React as well that some newbie programmer saddled the company with 4 years ago but has now left to ruin someone else’s technology stack.\\n\\nIt’s time to relegate Angular (and the others) to the junk pile of failed experiments where it belongs.\\n\\nWhat Should Replace Angular?\\n\\nThe answer is quite simply—replace it with nothing. Get rid of it entirely. Rip it out and write plain, easy to use and understand JavaScript enclosures.\\n\\nI’m not opposed to using open source libraries like jQuery, or other UI components, or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. These can be “included” with one or two lines of code and they actually do make our lives as develoeprs a lot easier!\\n\\nBut if the framework needs Node.js to run, like Tailwind, or you need to train and re-train people to use it because the maintainers keep updating it year after year, that stuff is just costing you money—and for what? It’s “super-cool” to use?\\n\\nThe bottom line is Angular is gumming up the works; it’s costing your company thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, and if you’re a Fortune 1,000 enterprise, it’s likely costing you millions each year in maintenance, updates, training, and lost time just finding experienced people (or people who even want) to support the monstrosity.\\n\\nWhenever I see a company desperate for UI engineers, invariably now they NEED someone with 3 to 5 years of Angular experience. That’s nonsense. I can build elegant, fully functional UI in less time with plain JS, and without all of the Angular frontend and backend complexity.\\n\\nJavaScript encloses built with single-minded purposes provide the perfect fit and balance between harnessing the complexities of modern UI while maintaining elegant simplicity within the DOM.\\n\\nIf something breaks in production with an enclosure written in plain JS, it takes seconds to find the problem within any browser’s dev tools, and I don’t need to install or include yet another layer of bloat to tell me how to debug the compiled code.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe Holy Grail of writing code, any code, lies within its simplicity. However, as modern engineers, we’ve all but totally lost sight of that simplicity. We’ve gotten caught up in the fad of whatever shiny new tech has gotten released from which ever fav tech giant or college has shoved in our face as “state-of-the-art”.\\n\\nWell, Google or whichever university isn’t paying your staffing bills. It’s time CTO’s took charge of the technology stack, deprecated the fad-tech, and returned all of us to rational reasoned UI that is simple, maintainable, and beautiful.\\n\\nMore content at plainenglish.io',\n",

              "   'The Dawn of a New Era\\n\\nOn the 6th of August 1991, the web went live to the world. Then eventually we had the so-called dot-com bubble come and go. Consider for a moment that the web only came into existence for public use in 1991, and then nine years later the dot-com bubble burst, costing an astonishing $1.7 trillion. That means that the dot-com bubble cost about as much as 15% of the United States’ GDP that same year.\\n\\nWe’re in that part of history because that’s about the time when the web was starting to become more and more formal, and the way we were writing websites was becoming more standardized. Over time, we gained standards like HTML4 that we could use, and these standards ensured that the HTML you write in your part of the world will work for most, if not all, HTML interpreters. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) also entered circulation in 1996, and the year before that, JavaScript also entered the scene. Can you imagine seeing or using a website with no JavaScript or CSS? It would not be an enjoyable experience, that’s for sure.\\n\\nBut throughout all of history, some things with the web stayed the same. To be fair, a lot of it had to: You would never want to introduce breaking changes to the HTML standard without an extremely good reason for doing so, so changing large swathes of how the web works in future versions was probably never going to happen. This left us with the web as we have it today, and what does that include?\\n\\nThe document\\n\\nWhen the web first came into existence, people were not using apps as they are today. Some of you may remember using terminals that acted as thin clients, giving you a physical connection to a mainframe on the other end of the physical connection. The “apps” (if you could call them that) that people had were little more than lines of text on a screen. People were used to dealing with things as documents, as physical pieces of paper in their hands that they could peruse. It comes as no surprise then that the basis of HTML pages is to produce an HTML document. If you’ve ever used any JavaScript, you will be familiar with functions like document.getElementById() . Everything that you do on a webpage is to produce and then transform the document.\\n\\nTraditionally, most webpages are too high to fit in one viewport. So the user would have to swipe through the page with their finger or scroll with the mouse. I can’t think of a website that I use today that fits neatly into the users’ viewport (certainly not this diatribe), so the developer would always be guaranteed that there would be some part of the page that would either be above or below where the user was currently looking on their page.\\n\\nBut still, you would want certain parts of your webpage to stay in a certain position or align in a certain way. You start using things like position in CSS to control where your elements are laid out. There’s a tonne of CSS properties (520 to be exact), and as the name would imply, these styles cascade into their child elements. When you are trying to get a particular part of your document to look a certain way, it can get fairly chaotic. If you are using an existing styling framework like Angular Material, then it also gets pretty zesty, as you start to override the built-in CSS to achieve a certain look that you are after. CSS lets you override this by using !important , but once you start doing that, the battle is largely lost. If you’re reading this and thinking to yourself “What? This guy sounds like he is hopeless at CSS,” then that’s okay and I wouldn’t fight you on that point. But when your designers are chasing a certain look, the CSS can get pretty complicated.\\n\\nPhoto by Pankaj Patel on Unsplash\\n\\nLearning the languages\\n\\nIn order to create a simple website, you need to be across three separate languages, and that’s purely for the website itself. That’s HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Your website has to look and feel great, and it can’t do that if you don’t know how to write performant JavaScript or if your CSS styling is bad.\\n\\nIf you actually want your website to do anything, then you might use a framework like Angular or React. As you start to bring in packages via npm, the size of your app starts to grow, so you will also use a bundler like webpack to tie all your packages together and minify them appropriately. Webpack is a topic in itself (and a huge one at that) but it’s a worthwhile topic to consider and does form a considerable part of building web apps.\\n\\nBundling and transpilations\\n\\nOnce you have your website and you have your packages, you need to use a bundler to bundle up your client app and to make sure that it works in their browser. Depending on what browser they are using, you’ll also need to “shim” in certain features so the user’s browser can actually use your website. If you’re using a language like TypeScript, webpack also transpiles from this language into JavaScript. Nothing about this is inherently bad, but it is very complex and has a lot of moving parts. If your website breaks, did you mess up the code, or did the minification break it, or did webpack not include it properly, or did the transpilation process introduce a problem? These complicated pipelines can introduce difficulties in debugging or finding the root cause of issues in your app.',\n",

Look, they’re writing code AND looking at a “Getting Started” page. Hire them. Photo by Safar Safarov on Unsplash.\\n\\nThe title of this post was a trending Quora question, with popular responses boiling down to “it’s not, the unemployment rate is 3.6%,” “there are too many developers and not enough engineers,” and “it’s a natural consequence of microeconomic theory.” It might be useful to elaborate on the last one, but I thought it would be a lot more fun to take a look at the absolute most popular answer:\\n\\n“I was unemployed for many months. Waited hoping one day someone will hire me without requiring me to white-boarding. Yep it is worse than water-boarding. After 7 months I realized — no other choice. Now I can white board in my sleep. Companies are in line to talk to me. They are ready to send flowers and even ready to send drivers to pick me up. Nothing changed”\\n\\n— Aravind Akshan, Engineer Manager at [UNDISCLOSED]\\n\\nInstead of providing a cliche response about the difference between developers and engineers, this legend pokes fun at the entire interviewing process. If you expand the other threads in this post, you will see a few arguments about whether or not the software engineer interviewing process is flawed.\\n\\nIn all seriousness, though, the response about economics is worth discussing. Job pay is heavily influenced by supply and demand. While there is a very high demand for software engineers, there are now 4.4 million software developers in the United States alone [Edited. The original sentence said “4.4 million software engineers”]. In other words, software engineers are not extremely rare, and a degree in computer science is not the golden ticket some people may expect. I think the popularity of computer science and the surge of coding bootcamps are a testament to how accepted this has become as a field.\\n\\nOther possible reasons one may find it difficult to find a software engineering job:\\n\\nAt most companies I have interviewed with, it takes at least three interviews to get a job. This is elaborated on pretty well here, in an article by the BBC\\n\\nTechnical coding interviews are, for lack of a better description, “their own game.” You typically get between 30 minutes to an hour to solve a coding question that assesses your understanding of data structures and algorithms. Regardless of whether you think this is a good test, supporters and critics alike would agree that this is not what you actually do in the field — it’s just a test\\n\\nSoftware is BROAD. You can be a frontend developer turning wireframes into a web application. You can be a backend engineer who works very closely with hardware. You can work at a company that cures cancer. You can work at a company that causes cancer. There is an incredible number of fields and roles you may have, and so we face the same scenario we face when dating: Companies will look for a very, very specific candidate with an exact set of skills, and sometimes things just don’t work out\\n\\nI may be the first person in history with the gall to complain about this, but in coding interviews you usually get a choice of language. One drawback to this is that the engineer interviewing you, if he/she is human, will not be familiar with all of them. If you interview in a language they are unfamiliar with and have any issues, they may not be able to help you\\n\\nWhat to Expect in the Job Interview Process?\\n\\nBananas.\\n\\nThere are lots of “opening strategies” you may follow. Maybe a company’s HR reaches out to you first on LinkedIn; maybe you choose to trust a third party recruiter. Your mileage may vary with third party recruiters (also referred to as “head hunters”), but to put it bluntly, there is a reason they have such a bad reputation. Some of them are really, really bad. The bad ones will try to set you up with a company that is not a good fit, they will “shotgun blast” requests to anyone and everyone, and they will not have your best interest in mind. What they want from the arrangement is money.\\n\\n…Though, to be fair, that is probably also what you want.\\n\\nMaybe you decide to reach out to a friend instead. Maybe you reach out to HR departments directly, or you decide to do what a zillion other people are doing and just try to indeed-easy-apply your way to success.\\n\\nThe initial call with HR\\n\\nThere are a lot of tech companies trying to make it right now, and some of them are pretty random. One company was delivering medical supplies via tiny drones. One company was trying to disrupt healthcare by making customers pay hundreds of dollars every month to see more doctors. The weirdest company I have ever interacted with was building a dating app…as if people would pay for an app where you swiped right to determine potential matches.\\n\\nI wonder what happened to them?\\n\\nThey will ask if “now is still a good time.” If it were not a good time, then you probably should not have picked up. I missed one initial interview when I had to unclog a toilet\\n\\nThey will ask you to talk about yourself\\n\\nThey may ask what you are looking for in your next role. A good answer to this is probably some variation of “your company, basically.” I once answered this by saying all I really wanted to do was not work in a specific industry (let’s say, for the sake of example, that it was the auto industry). They said that they recently acquired a contract with the auto industry. It was one of the most awkward interviews I have had\\n\\nThey will really try to pitch their company\\n\\nThey may ask some really interesting questions, like what your favorite project was or what your values are, but I find this to be pretty rare\\n\\nIt may seem like the initial HR call is just a formality, but it actually can be the first hurdle. An HR representative can ask you for your skill set, jot down some notes, and then decide whether or not you are a good fit.\\n\\nThe Automated Coding Test\\n\\nThis is my least favorite aspect of interviews. Some companies have you take an automated coding test to advance to the next step. I think it would make a lot more sense if companies had you do this immediately after applying, then moved you along to HR if you passed. They could have HR look at your resume, send you a link if they thought you were qualified, and then have a 30-minute talk with them if you passed.\\n\\nThe Coding Interview\\n\\nThis is really the meat of it. They have written entire books about this step.\\n\\nChoose a programming language you are familiar with. Most companies give you a choice, which is a little crazy to me considering how you can use an obscure language no one at the company uses…I never have, but in theory, you could\\n\\nThis is a really good guide\\n\\nThis resource is cuter than Maxine the corgi\\n\\nWhile it is true that you can cycle through common data structures in your head when stuck on a problem, and that hashmaps are commonly part of the solution, don’t just pull a hashmap out of nowhere. One of my first coding interviews ever went something like this:\\n\\nInterviewer: I’d like you to produce a compressed string. For example, you may turn aaaabbc into a4b2c1. You may turn a into a1\\n\\nMe: *immediately starts coding* Let’s use a hashmap\\n\\nInterviewer: Uh…well do you think you..\\n\\nMe: Okay, so we’ve made a hashmap. Now let’s make a bunch of print statements\\n\\nA hashmap is a useful tool, especially in these, but this isn’t an RPG. You don’t just immediately summon a hashmap and then crush every interview until you finally encounter the boss who can counter hashmaps (“oh no, guess I’d better bust out my ultimate move: The linked list!”).\\n\\nIn some leetcode-esque problems, you can get away with using an array instead of a hashmap (and you can use size 26 by subtracting ‘a’). Don’t rely on that for everything. Some of the simplest interview problems involve using a hashmap to take counts, and then going from there…you can’t just use a really big array without raising eyebrows.\\n\\nIt helps to know some useful calls, like std::sort or whatever the heck the equivalent is in other languages\\n\\nThe best interviewing experiences are like pair programming, where the two of you actually seem to be bouncing ideas off of each other. The worst interviews just involve the other person silently judging you\\n\\nThe final interview(s)\\n\\nThis is the part where things get a little bit…hardcore.\\n\\nYou might have four interviews in the same day. Maybe one is behavioral, maybe two are technical but harder than what you’ve seen before…and maybe one is system design.\\n\\nA Positive Attitude\\n\\nA wise, mature person would treat the software engineer interview process as a pure learning experience. He, or she, would enjoy learning about companies out there for the sake of research, interacting with key players, and mastering the art of whiteboarding. It would just be like a fun game.\\n\\nI don’t think of it like that, but a mature person would. Do what I say, not what I do.\\n\\nDid you like what you read?

In my previous two jobs, one time I got fired and another time I resigned.\\n\\nBut getting fired was a horrible experience for me. I cried the whole day. I never told anyone about that — my friends, my new colleagues. I felt so ashamed and humiliated that I made up some lie for all about why I left the last job.\\n\\nI couldn’t even tell my parents because they would get very upset. I only shared it with my boyfriend. He was so supportive and helped me to get a new and better job.\\n\\nLet’s get into the story.\\n\\nProblems of a low-funded startup\\n\\nI worked in a startup aged only one year. There were a total of four partners. They only had one angel investor and were looking for more investors. They mainly made enterprise solutions.\\n\\nYou know startups have many problems. One of the main problems is the funding problem. In the beginning, a startup has to do a lot of work but doesn’t have enough resources. It pays less but expects a lot of output from the developers.\\n\\nI joined there in February 2019. After three months, I got promoted from intern to junior developer. In the internship period, I got only $100/month. I had no regrets about that because I needed job experience.\\n\\nThere was a total of five programmers. All of us had to do a lot of work. We had to do overtime at least four out of six days a week. But the company didn’t pay us for the overtime. They never even said thanks. They acted like we were supposed to work overtime.\\n\\nThis is a red flag for developers. I would suggest to all the developers that if you find that your company always pushes you to work overtime without extra benefits, make a plan to change your job.\\n\\nBecause the scenario probably won’t change.\\n\\nArrogant CTO gave us more tasks than we could do\\n\\nThe CTO gave us all the tasks for a whole week. He didn’t care how fast or how slowly we did them. But he always gave us tons of work that would be very hard for even senior programmers to finish in a week.\\n\\nWe had no senior programmers. All of us were junior programmers. There was no tester, no designer. We had to work a minimum of nine or ten hours a day, 54–60 hours/week. If you didn’t work, you would lose your job.\\n\\nIf anyone couldn’t do all the tasks within time, he would humiliate them in front of all the other developers. He was one of the partners, so we couldn’t complain about him to a higher authority.\\n\\nIf anyone came to the office five minutes late, he cut their pay to a half day’s salary. But no one got extra money when they had to work for one or two hours extra.\\n\\nI missed two interviews because I couldn’t manage time to attend them and I was not in a position to take the risk of losing this job.\\n\\nApp crashed\\n\\nThen one day the CEO took on a new project that needed to be done within one and a half months: a mobile app and a web platform for building a customized delivery platform.\\n\\nThe initial target was to build a prototype to show a potential investor in order to raise money. The CTO told us that it’s very hard to get an appointment with that investor, so we had to build it within one and a half months.\\n\\nOne and a half months would be a very tight schedule for any team. We were very depressed when we heard we must have it made within that short time. We knew we all would have to do a lot of overtime.\\n\\nThey chose three developers for this project, including me. One was a backend developer, one was a Flutter mobile developer, and the other one was a frontend web developer (me).\\n\\nBut we still did it within time. Of course, there were bugs. We told this to both the CTO and the CEO. They seemed bothered but didn’t say anything at first.\\n\\nThe app crashed on mobile when it was being demonstrated in front of investors. It crashed because of a text field. The requirement of that text field was for numbers, but the CEO gave numbers and characters.\\n\\nFor fast development, we used Firebase’s Cloud Firestore to keep the data. When the user pushed string data instead of number data in Firestore from the mobile frontend side, the app crashed.\\n\\nThe investment was rejected, and we were the scapegoats\\n\\nInvestors rejected the investment. In my judgment, of course, the first fault was the CTO’s. He should never have taken this project on in this very short timeline.\\n\\nThe second fault was the CEO’s. He didn’t even try the app once before presenting it to the investors. He should have taken proper preparation because every app has bugs. And if you develop a project within one and a half months without testing, it will have many.\\n\\nToday’s young entrepreneurs might have many advantages but one major problem. That’s a lack of experience. If they had more, the working environment in a startup would be more productive.\\n\\nHowever, after getting rejected by the investors, the CEO wanted a clear explanation from the CTO. As usual, he didn’t say that the timeline was the problem.\\n\\nThe CTO said we were the problem. So we were the scapegoats. ☹\\n\\nTwo months’ salary and we are gone\\n\\nI was involved in front-end web development. I had no engagement in the mobile development side. Still, they fired me.

But I am not a designer, and they should have considered that.\\n\\nAccording to the job agreement, the company had to notify us two months before firing us. As the CEO got too upset, he fired us immediately with two months salary.\\n\\nI am thankful to that company because I had a two-month gap. In the meantime, I had applied to seven companies and found a job.\\n\\nBut I will never forget the shame. I know maybe I shouldn’t feel that way. But still, that memory haunts me down.\\n\\nLast few words\\n\\nNo one is perfect. Employers, please try to understand that. I am not saying we were the best programmers, but you shouldn’t demand that much output with poor management, an inexperienced CTO, and low-paid junior developers.\\n\\nNot all management is the same. I have faced and heard some great CEOs and CTOs. Somehow this was my worst job experience, and one of my worst life experiences.\\n\\nAnd I will say to all the developers to please don’t do this kind of job where you have no respect, no value, and a lot of pressure.

              "   'Stop Using Microservices. Build Monoliths Instead.\\n\\nPhoto by Robert Nagy from Pexels\\n\\nMicroservices can seem like the perfect solution.\\n\\nIn theory, they increase development speed while allowing you to scale different parts of your app independently.\\n\\nBut in reality, microservices come with hidden costs. That said, I don’t think you can truly appreciate their complexity without building them firsthand.\\n\\nHere is what I learned building (and sometimes failing) with microservices.\\n\\nManaging Data Is a Nightmare\\n\\nKeeping data in-sync across microservices can be challenging.\\n\\nA database per microservice is the recommended pattern. It allows loose coupling and permits service-specific teams to function independently without slowing down to collaborate on a shared code.\\n\\nBut what happens when one of two microservices that are supposed to fire in sync fails? For instance, one of those microservices updates its database but the other does not.\\n\\nSituations like this create inconsistencies in data.\\n\\nFrom personal experience, investigating data inconsistencies across services can be painful. The cross-service nature of the error requires a person to work across multiple services to rectify the error. Unfortunately, this then invalidates one of the benefits of microservices to begin with — team-specific services.\\n\\nThe same situation in a monolithic app could have easily been prevented by wrapping both DB calls in a single atomic transaction, so all inserts succeed or none of them do. Easy peasy.\\n\\nBut with microservices, loose coupling makes that more difficult.\\n\\nMore Time Setting Up\\n\\nBuilding out a microservices architecture takes longer than rolling the same features into a monolith.\\n\\nWhile an individual service is simple, a collection of services that interact is significantly more complex than a comparable monolith.\\n\\nFunctions in a monolith can call any other public functions. But functions in a microservice are restricted to calling functions in the same microservice.\\n\\nThis necessitates communication between services. Building APIs or a messaging system to facilitate this is non-trivial.\\n\\nAdditionally, code duplication across microservices can’t be avoided. Where a monolith could define a module once and import it many times, a microservice is its own app — modules and libraries need to be defined in each.\\n\\nMicroservices Work Best for Large Teams\\n\\nThe luxury of assigning microservices to individual teams is reserved for large engineering departments.\\n\\nAlthough it’s one of the big touted benefits of the architecture, it’s only feasible when you have the engineering headcount to dedicate several engineers to each service. Reducing code scope for developers gives them the bandwidth to understand their code better and increases development speed.\\n\\nBut most startups don’t have this luxury.\\n\\nIn an early-stage company without sufficient resources, some engineers will need to work across all services.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this reduces productivity because jumping across apps can be a serious switch of context.\\n\\nI found that investigating bugs in microservices I hadn’t worked on in awhile was exhausting.\\n\\nDevOps Is More Complicated\\n\\nOne of the most compelling reasons for choosing microservices is the ability to run different services on different types of servers.\\n\\nWhy? A React frontend can have very different memory, CPU, and up-time requirements than a service that trains machine learning models. The right type of infrastructure for each service can drastically lower costs.\\n\\nBut it comes with its own challenges.\\n\\nCase in point: Early in my career, I once lost a tonne of production data because I forgot to restart a service on which I’d updated code. The outdated code received data via API requests, but then silently failed instead of recording it in its database. That data was lost forever.\\n\\nI give this point to illustrate that it’s more work to configure, maintain and monitor multiple microservices compared to a single monolithic app. Having multiple apps also increases the attack vector for hackers.\\n\\nIn theory, “loosely coupled” services allow each service to continue functioning if others fail. But that’s wishful thinking —true loose coupling is rarely possible for a complex business with customers.\\n\\nIn the end, your app architecture is only as reliable as the weakest piece. The more moving pieces, the more chance for error.\\n\\nTakeaways\\n\\nA lot of companies use microservices without really needing them. And despite their current popularity, microservices aren’t for beginners.\\n\\nMost companies would be better off building a monolith and then splitting off pieces of the monolith into microservices when absolutely necessary.\\n\\nLeave rolling a microservice architecture from scratch for large tech companies with deep pockets.\\n\\nYour early-stage startup probably isn’t ready. Mine wasn’t, and it cost us significant time and energy.',\n",

              "   'Data science has the curious distinction of being one of the few fields of study that leaves the practitioner without a domain. Pharmacy students become pharmacists, law students become lawyers, accounting students become accountants. Data science students must therefore become data scientists? But data scientists of what? The broad application of data science proves to be a double edged sword. On one side, it is a powerful toolbox that can be applied to any industry where data is generated and captured. On the other, the general applicability of these tools means that rarely will the user have true domain knowledge of said industries before the fact. Nevertheless, the problem was insignificant during the rise of data science as employers rushed to harness this nascent technology without fully understanding what it was and how it could be fully integrated into their company.\\n\\nHowever, nearly a decade later, both businesses and the environment they operate in have evolved. They now strive for data science maturity with large entrenched teams benchmarked by established industry standards. The pressing hiring demand has shifted to problem solvers and critical thinkers who understand the business, the respective industry as well as its stakeholders. No longer will the ability navigate a couple of software packages or regurgitate a few lines of code suffice, nor will a data science practitioner be defined by the ability to code. This is evidenced by the increasing popularity of no code, autoML solutions such as Data Robot, Rapid Miner and Alteryx.\\n\\nWhat Does This Mean?\\n\\nData scientists will be extinct in 10 years (give or take), or at least the role title will be. Going forward, the skill set collectively known as data science will be borne by a new generation of data savvy business specialists and subject matter experts who are able to imbue analysis with their deep domain knowledge, irrespective of whether they can code or not. Their titles will reflect their expertise rather than the means by which they demonstrate it, be it compliance specialists, product managers or investment analysts. We don’t need to look back far to find historic precedents. During the advent of the spreadsheet, data entry specialists were highly coveted, but nowadays, as Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (the author of “Storytelling With Data”) aptly observes, proficiency with Microsoft Office suite is a bare minimum. Before that, the ability to touch type with a typewriter was considered a specialist skill, however with the accessibility of personal computing it has also become assumed.\\n\\nLastly, for those considering a career in data science or commencing their studies, it may serve you well to constantly refer back to the Venn diagram that you will undoubtedly come across. It describes data science as an confluence of statistics, programming and domain knowledge. Despite each occupying an equal share of the intersecting area, some may warrant a higher weighting than others.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Views are my own, based on my observations and experiences.

              "   'Prerequisite: Angular, Typescript, ng-template, ng-container\\n\\nWhen I first start an Angular 2+ project, the first thing I look up for is a component library. I test some and then I choose a winner. Everything is great, I can focus on my business logic now and just use some already built components, like table, toogles, tabs, wizards, with a lot of built in functionality.\\n\\nUsually, I use a component multiple times in my project, some of them even hundreds of times. But, at some point, I realise that the component that I am using is no longer satisfying my needs and, in time, I find a new one that is exactly what I need.\\n\\nAnd now, comes the question. What should I do? To add the new component in my project which means to style it to look as similar to the old one, and to have two components for the same functionality or to just replace the old one with the new one. Obviously, the choice is to replace the old one with the new one. But what happens if I already used the component hundreds of times? The amount of work to replace it would be enormous.\\n\\nThat’s why, right after I choose the best library component, the first thing that I do, is to create wrappers around the most used components in my application. In this way, changing the library component is really easy and I also have to work only in one place and everything will change accordingly. Also, creating a wrapper will give me a lot of flexibility. Let’s assume that I need to style all tab’s in my app, or to add a new icon on every tab header. This would be quite easy, as I would have to change in one place, and it would change in every place that I use the component.\\n\\nWe will pass through an example of creating our Tab Wrapper Component based on NGXBootstrap.\\n\\nWe first install the ngx-bootstrap library and import TabsModule (https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/tabs).\\n\\nNgxBootstrap tab component looks like this:\\n\\nAs you can see, we are using a tabset with a template for heading, because, probably sometimes, we will need to set a custom tab header.\\n\\nWe want to create a component, app-tab-wrapper, that will encapsulate tabset and expose the inputs and methods that we need.\\n\\nOur final component html should be the following:\\n\\nFor this, we need to create 2 directives, one that is the container for tabs (tabs-items) and one that represents the tab (tab-item).\\n\\nThe first one, tabs-items should look like:\\n\\nAnd the second one, tab-item:\\n\\nFinally, our wrapper component ts is:\\n\\nAnd the html:\\n\\nOf course, this is quite a simple example, in a real world project, we would have much more inputs and outputs from our wrapper.\\n\\nBut, using this technique, we will have a lot of flexibility in the future regarding our component library and it will be really easy to change the entire components library without affecting our codebase or business logic. Of course, this will take some time at the beginning, but in the long term, this is a good investition for every company because you are lowering the future costs of changing components library.\\n\\nFull project repository and stackblitz project can be found here https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-bootstrap-tab-wrapper. If you have any questions about wrappers or you need help in creating one, feel free to ask.\\n\\nRead more at plainenglish.io',\n",

Our application won’t just be one page, it will probably have many pages. How will users be able to navigate between them?\\n\\nRouting is the practice of selecting a path for traffic in a network. Or, in more basic terms, defining what happens when you click on a link inside of a webpage and where you get redirected.\\n\\nReact is a library — it does not contain everything you need for your application out of the box (in our case, routing). Therefore, we will need to install react router.\\n\\nReact router has different components for web applications and for native ones. Since we are building a web application, we will be using react-router-dom .\\n\\nyarn add react-router-dom\\n\\nTo make use of routing in our application, let’s create a navigation element which will be visible at the top of the application. We will be adding this inside our App.js file and replacing the current HTML markup that’s there.\\n\\nUsually, in a non-React project, we would put a relative path to our HTML pages for each section. That way, the browser knows where to load the data from.\\n\\nHowever, in our project, we won’t have different HTML pages for each section — we will just load a different component. The markup that used to be inside of App.js will now be found inside a component called Home .\\n\\nHome.jsx\\n\\nAs we’ve created three sections in our navigation and taken care of the home section, let’s give another example with the About section.\\n\\nWe’ll create a new file called About.jsx that will hold our template and code for the About section:\\n\\nYou may be asking, how will the application know to redirect the user once they click on the about link? For that we use a component called Route .\\n\\nRoute is one of the most important components in react-router because it lets you render different component based on the path of the URL. For our project, we will use the code below inside of App.js just below the navigation markup.\\n\\nYou can see that we have created two routes — for Home and About. The Switch component lets us group route components together — it will only match one of them.\\n\\nOur combined App.js file looks like this:\\n\\nApp.js\\n\\nOne last thing we should do is wrap the entire project in a Router component. We need to do this because it enables us to use routing in our application. We will be using the BrowserRouter component as it uses HTML5’s history API.\\n\\nindex.js\\n\\nIf we run things locally, everything seems to work.

              "   \"I have a bit of a love hate relationship with CSS. Before my pivot into computer programming I used to do a lot of graphic design. So when I first started making webpages it was exceptionally frustrating when I couldn’t make them look the way I wanted them to. My background in graphic design is both a gift and a curse. Sure I learned about leading, kerning, rivers, widows, orphans, runts, and justified vs. rag type. Knowing about these details and knowing that I can manipulate them using CSS but not yet having the knowledge to do so is very frustrating. Until I learn some CSS that’s new and useful. Then I get that ‘click’ that programmers talk about. I want to learn more and more to the point that I‘ll spend hours on an about page on my localhost until it looks perfect. Even if I’m the only person who will ever see that about page the learning process is the key. I’m going to give you a couple CSS tips so when someone does see your webpage, you’ll be proud to show them.\\n\\nTip #1: Child Combinator\\n\\nThe ‘child combinator’ matches the elements of the second selector that are the direct children of the first element you pass it. This can be very useful if you want to style all of the <p> tags inside a div (div > p). Another useful application would be adding <a> tags in your footer (#footer > a), something a lot of websites have.\\n\\nSeveral <a> tags in a footer you may be familiar with\\n\\nCSS\\n\\n//format\\n\\nelement1 > element2 {\\n\\nstyle properties\\n\\n} span {\\n\\nfont-weight: normal;\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\ndiv > span {\\n\\nfont-weight: bold;\\n\\n}\\n\\nHTML\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n<span>Span #1, inside the div.\\n\\n<span>Span #2, inside the span that's inside the div.</span>\\n\\n</span>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<span>Span #3, outside of the div.</span>\\n\\nResult\\n\\nSpan #1, inside the div. Span #2, inside the span that’s inside the div.\\n\\nSpan #3, outside of the div.\\n\\nTip #2: Selecting Multiple Elements\\n\\nConsistency of design can make your webpage look more cohesive and focused. Don’t be afraid to use both serif and sans-serif fonts on the same page but try to limit yourself to two complimentary fonts. If you’re going to add a border to something it might also be nice if several elements, that maybe already have the same font, font-size, and color also have the same border. Did you know you can assign all these things at once? Not only can you use multiple selectors, you can use classes too.\\n\\n.article, img, .toolbar {\\n\\nborder: 1px solid #78c5c5;\\n\\nfont-family: Verdana;\\n\\nbackground-color #323232\\n\\n}\\n\\nTip #3: Drop Caps\\n\\np:first-letter {\\n\\nfloat: left;\\n\\nfont-size: 3rem;\\n\\nline-height: 0.65;\\n\\nmargin: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em 0;\\n\\ncolor:#60c0c0;\\n\\n}\\n\\nTip #4: Hovering\\n\\nI know what you’re thinking, Hollywood lied to us, we should have hover-boards and hover-cars and hover-cities by now and even though they don’t appear to be feasible in my lifetime I can use hover effects in CSS right now. It’s pretty simple to do but try not to get too flashy with it the way I might have below.\\n\\nCSS\\n\\nimg {\\n\\nborder: 1px solid #000;\\n\\n} img {\\n\\nborder: 1px solid #f00;\\n\\nfilter: invert(100%);\\n\\n}\\n\\nHTML\\n\\n<img>\\n\\n<%= image_tag(Album.last.artwork, size: “400”) %>\\n\\n</img> <%= image_tag(Album.last.artwork, size: “400”) %>\\n\\n<%# Please note that this is written in ruby %>\\n\\nResult\\n\\nRemember these tips when writing your CSS (or refer back to this post). I know that the hover and drop cap are more fun to view but the other techniques will help you save time and keep you from making so many ids, which can be really overwhelming. The more you practice these tips the more you be able to build off of them and create elegant webpages. Good luck and keep coding.\",\n",

Even though the final product of this company is a soft drink, the process of manufacturing can be divided into two subprocesses. One where the bottles are getting manufactured and another where the drinks are getting manufactured. When both these products are ready, the drink is filled in the bottle, sealed, and packed.\\n\\nIf you notice here, the manufacturing of the bottles and drink were not interdependent. Both the manufacturing processes were happening in parallel in such a way that neither the drink nor the bottle had to wait for the completion of the other product.\\n\\nLet us now look at an example in the software industry. There is a certificate validation website, which accepts as many as 10 certificates at a time. It provides the authenticity of these certificates by validating them against the corresponding issuing authority. Suppose in this workflow, the application takes one certificate at a time, validates it, and then picks the next certificate, the amount of time the user will be waiting for this to get completed will be very high. This, in turn, will reduce the incoming users to the website. But, imagine if the website can get the input of all the 10 certificates and validate it simultaneously so that the user doesn’t need to wait for a longer time. Will this be not an encouraging factor for the user to visit again and again to validate more and more things? The validation process is after all much quicker. That is the advantage of doing things asynchronously.\\n\\nIn this blog, we are going to understand what is asynchronous programming and how to achieve it in C#.\\n\\nTable of contents\\n\\nWhat is asynchronous programming? When to use asynchronous programming Return types of an asynchronous program Implementing asynchronous programming in C# Key concepts of asynchronous programming Conclusion\\n\\nWhat is asynchronous programming?\\n\\nAsynchronous programming is an effective way to reduce the delay or wait time that is happening in the code. It avoids the following scenario — an activity is blocked in a synchronous process, which will in turn block the entire application by blocking the other tasks from executing.\\n\\nKeywords async and await are used in C# for achieving asynchronous programming. To make a function asynchronous, the async keyword will be added in front of the method name. Below is an example of the syntax of an asynchronous method.\\n\\npublic async Task DoWork(){ }\\n\\nWhen to use asynchronous programming?\\n\\nWhenever there is a blocking code that is independent of the remaining process in the code execution, then asynchronous programming can be implemented.\\n\\nOn executing a particular method asynchronously, it gets executed in a separate thread and not in the main thread. Also, for long-running tasks, asynchronous programming can be implemented to make the main thread free.\\n\\nAsynchronous programming can be implemented in the below areas:\\n\\nFile read/write operations that are independent of the main activity of the application. Third-party API calls Loading of maps or special plugins that needs to be loaded in the application other than the main content. Code logics that are independent of the main operation. Example — Logging that a user has signed in and browsing this product while product details are still pulled in the main thread and displayed to the user.\\n\\nReturn types of an asynchronous program\\n\\nLet’s now see the different return types that the async methods support -\\n\\nvoid — if void has been mentioned as the return type for an async method, then the method is not awaitable. In that case, the method is called the ‘fire and forget’ method, where the execution of the async method happens in parallel in a separate thread other than the main thread.\\n\\nTask — To make a method awaitable, the return type of the method has to be made as a task so that it doesn’t return any data to the calling method.\\n\\nTask T — To make a method awaitable and return any type of data, task T can be used.\\n\\nImplementing asynchronous programming in C#\\n\\nIn this section, let’s see in detail how to implement asynchronous programming in C#.\\n\\nStep 1\\n\\nCreate a .Net-based Console application and provide a valid name for the project.\\n\\nStep 2\\n\\nOnce the project is created, the solution will have the below files.\\n\\nStep 3\\n\\nOpen the Program.cs file and update the code to have two methods; each method will have a loop. Let’s say, the first method has a loop of 20 iterations and the second method has a loop of 10 iterations.\\n\\nStep 4\\n\\nAfter updating the code, let’s run the code in the synchronous mode and observe the results.\\n\\nYou can notice that method 1 was first completely executed and later method 2 was executed. Here both method 1 and method 2 were not interdependent, but still, method 2 had to wait until method 1 was completely executed.\\n\\nNow let’s implement asynchronous programming for method 1 and observe how it impacts the result.\\n\\nStep 5\\n\\nTo implement asynchronous programming, let’s add async Task to method1 header. And inside the method, add the code as shown in the below image.\\n\\nAfter adding the code, let’s run the application. Take a look at the results tab. You will notice that initially, method1 got executed, but later method 2 also started to get executed in the middle without waiting for method 1 to get completed. In short, both the methods were running asynchronously without waiting for each other.\\n\\nKey concepts of asynchronous programming\\n\\nNow that we have seen how to implement asynchronous programming in C#. Let’s understand some key concepts in implementing it -\\n\\nAsynchronous methods should be called using the await keyword, else they will be running synchronously. Method input parameters cannot be declared as async. The main method cannot be declared as asynchronous and the await key cannot be used inside it. In a try/catch/finally block, asynchronous calls can be made only inside the try block.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAsynchronous programming in C# is easy to achieve using the async and await keyword. It provides the advantage of executing the long-running and independent methods in a separate thread as that of the main thread. It improves the responsiveness of the application which thereby increases customer satisfaction.',\n",

              "   'Hello! My name is Josh, and I am a smart contract engineer on the Flow Team at Dapper Labs.\\n\\nIf you’re new here, welcome! This is a blog about Cadence, Flow’s new state-of-the-art language for smart contracts. I recommend starting out with my first post about beginner materials before reading this.\\n\\nI also have realized that I was a little overconfident when initially committing to writing the blog weekly, so from now on, I’ll only be posting a new blog once every two weeks. I apologize if I’ve crushed your dreams.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nEvery few posts, I am going to dedicate my post to highlighting an interesting project or contribution that I have seen from the community! The Cadence and Flow communities are global and growing, and I want to showcase all the cool projects that people are building.\\n\\nFor my first one, I actually want to highlight some projects that were written last year for the Cadence Cup, a three-round competition that challenged participants to build interesting smart contract prototypes that utilized unique features of Cadence for each round. Every round had a lot of great submissions, and they are all really good resources to learn about some of the different things you can do with Cadence.\\n\\nDisclaimer: These projects were written using much earlier versions of Cadence than are available now, so they will not work with the latest version of Cadence in the playground. Even still, they are a great thing to study to see different coding styles. You could even challenge yourself by picking one of the projects and updating it so it works with the latest version of Cadence!\\n\\nWeek 1: NFT Minting\\n\\nWe challenged participants to build an NFT contract with a unique mechanism for minting. Check out these links for the challenge description and winners!\\n\\nWeek 2: Voting Mechanisms\\n\\nThere is a super basic voting smart contract in the Cadence tutorials, but we were curious to see what special voting systems our participants could come up with.\\n\\nWeek 3: Resources that own other Resources\\n\\nOne unique (and super cool!) feature of Cadence is that resources can own other resources. This enables features like NFT collections and Kitty Items like are shown in the Cadence tutorials, but there are WAY MORE possibilities! We wanted to see what cool ideas the participants could come up with for this fun feature.\\n\\nI highly recommending checking out all of the submission that interest you!\\n\\nAlso, many of the participants are still active in the the Flow community, and some of them have even joined the Flow team as developers or community managers! I’m sure they’ll be happy to help answer any of your questions about their projects. 😃\\n\\nAnd who knows? Maybe we’ll do another Cadence Cup in the near future! 😉\\n\\nCompetition would certainly be more fierce!\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIf you have any questions, the entire Flow team and community is here to support you! Please do not hesitate to reach out via our Discord server, the Flow Forum, or via an issue in the Flow Github repo.\\n\\nAre there any other topics or interesting projects that you know would useful to newcomers or that you would like me to write a blog post about? Feel free to comment with your ideas and I might include them in a future post!\\n\\nFlow Discord: https://discord.gg/flow\\n\\nFlow Forum: https://forum.onflow.org\\n\\nFlow Github: https://github.com/onflow/flow\\n\\nSee you next week! 👋',\n",

              "   'Photo by Andrew Pons on Unsplash\\n\\nManipulating files and directories are basic operations for any program. Since Node.js is a server side platform and can interact with the computer that it’s running on directly, being able to manipulate files is a basic feature. Fortunately, Node.js has a fs module built into its library. It has many functions that can help with manipulating files and folders. File and directory operation that are supported include basic ones like manipulating and opening files in directories. Likewise, it can do the same for files. It can do this both synchronously and asynchronously. It has an asynchronous API that have functions that support promises. Also it can show statistics for a file. Almost all the file operations that we can think of can be done with the built in fs module. In this article, we will rename items stored on disk with the rename family of functions and remove directories with the rmdir family of functions.\\n\\nRenaming Items with fs.rename and fs.renameSync\\n\\nTo rename items stored on disk in a Node.js program, we can call the rename function asynchronously. It takes 3 arguments. The first argument is the old path of the file. which can be a string, a Buffer object, or an URL object.\\n\\nThe second argument is the new path of the file, which also can be a string, a Buffer object, or an URL object.\\n\\nThe last argument is a callback function that’s called when the item rename operation ends. The callback function takes an err parameter which has the error data if the rename operation ends with an error, otherwise, the err object is null .\\n\\nThe original file must exist before renaming it. If the path of the item you want to rename to already exists, then that item will be overwritten. If the destination path is a directory, then an error will be raised.\\n\\nFor example, we can use it like in the following code:\\n\\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\\n\\nconst sourceFile = \"./files/originalFile.txt\";\\n\\nconst destFile = \"./files/renamedFile.txt\"; fs.rename(sourceFile, destFile, err => {\\n\\nif (err) throw err;\\n\\nconsole.log(\"Rename complete!\");\\n\\n});\\n\\nWe can do the same for directories:\\n\\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\\n\\nconst oldDirectory = \"./files/oldFolder\";\\n\\nconst newDirectory = \"./files/newFolder\"; fs.rename(oldDirectory, newDirectory, err => {\\n\\nif (err) throw err;\\n\\nconsole.log(\"Directory rename complete!\");\\n\\n});\\n\\nThe synchronous version of the rename function is the renameSync function. It takes the same arguments as the rename but without the callback. The first argument is the old path of the file. which can be a string, a Buffer object, or an URL object. The second argument is the new path of the file, which also can be a string, a Buffer object, or an URL object. It returns undefined .\\n\\nFor example, we can rename a file with the renameSync function like in the following code:\\n\\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\\n\\nconst sourceFile = \"./files/originalFile.txt\";\\n\\nconst destFile = \"./files/renamedFile.txt\"; try {\\n\\nfs.renameSync(sourceFile, destFile);\\n\\nconsole.log(\"Rename complete!\");\\n\\n} catch (error) {\\n\\nconsole.log(error);\\n\\n}\\n\\nThere’s also a promise version of the rename function, which also does the rename operation asynchronously. It takes 2 arguments.\\n\\nThe first argument is the old path of the file. which can be a string, a Buffer object, or an URL object.\\n\\nThe second argument is the new path of the file, which also can be a string, a Buffer object, or an URL object. The promise version of the rename function returns a promise that resolves without argument with the rename operation is successful. For example, we can use it like in the following code:\\n\\nconst fsPromises = require(\"fs\").promises;\\n\\nconst sourceFile = \"./files/originalFile.txt\";\\n\\nconst destFile = \"./files/renamedFile.txt\"; (async () => {\\n\\ntry {\\n\\nawait fsPromises.rename(sourceFile, destFile);\\n\\nconsole.log(\"Rename complete!\");\\n\\n} catch (error) {\\n\\nconsole.log(error);\\n\\n}\\n\\n})();\\n\\nThis is a better choice than renameSync for running sequential operations because asynchronous operations like promises won’t holding the program’s execution when it’s running, which means that other parts of the program can run if the operation isn’t finished.\\n\\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\\n\\nRemoving Directories with fs.rmdir and fs.rmdirSync\\n\\nTo remove directories asynchronously we can use the rmdir function. It takes 3 arguments.\\n\\nThe first is the path of the directory, which can be a string, a Buffer object or an URL object.\\n\\nThe second argument is an object that takes a few option properties. The emFileWait property is an integer that let our program retry if an EMFILE error is encountered.\\n\\nIt is the maximum number of milliseconds that we wait to try deleting the directory again. The rmdir function will retry every 1ms until the emFileWait value is reached.\\n\\nDefault value is 1000. The maxBusyTries is an integer is the number of retries when the EBUSY , ENOTEMPTY or EPERM error is encountered. It will retry every 100 milliseconds up to the maxBusyTries value. The recursive property is a boolean property.\\n\\nIf it’s set to true , then it will recursively delete data inside the directory along with the directory itself. In recursive mode, errors aren’t reported if path doesn’t exist and operations are retried on failure. The default value is false .\\n\\nRecursive mode is an experimental feature. The last argument is a callback function which has an err parameter. It’s called when the removal operation ends. It’s null if the directory removal operation succeeds.\\n\\nOtherwise, it returns an object with the error information. Using the regular asynchronous version of the rmdir function with files results in the promise being rejected with the ENOENT error on Windows and an ENOTDIR error on POSIX operating systems.\\n\\nFor example, we can use it like in the following code:\\n\\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\\n\\nconst dirToDelete = \"./files/deleteFolder\"; fs.rmdir(\\n\\ndirToDelete,\\n\\n{\\n\\nemfileWait: 2000,\\n\\nmaxBusyTries: 5,\\n\\nrecursive: false\\n\\n},\\n\\nerr => {\\n\\nif (err) {\\n\\nthrow err;\\n\\n}\\n\\nconsole.log(\"Removal complete!\");\\n\\n}\\n\\n);\\n\\nThe directory with the given path should be gone when the code above is ran if it exists and it’s not being used by other programs.\\n\\nThe synchronous version of the rmdir function is the rmdirSync function. It takes similar arguments as the rmdir function. The first argument is the path to the directory, which can be a string, a Buffer object or an URL object.\\n\\nThe second argument is an object that takes one option property. The recursive property is a boolean property. If it’s set to true , then it will recursively delete data inside the directory along with the directory itself. In recursive mode, errors aren’t reported if path doesn’t exist and operations are retried on failure. The default value is false .\\n\\nRecursive mode is an experimental feature. It returns undefined .\\n\\nWe can use the rmdirSync function like in the following code:\\n\\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\\n\\nconst dirToDelete = \"./files/deleteFolder\"; fs.rmdirSync(dirToDelete, {\\n\\nrecursive: false\\n\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(\"Removal complete!\");\\n\\nThe directory with the given path should be gone when the code above is ran if it exists and it’s not being used by other programs.\\n\\nThe promise version of the rmdir function does the same thing as the regular rmdir function. It takes 2 arguments. The first is the path of the directory, which can be a string, a Buffer object or an URL object. The second argument is the an object that takes a few option properties.\\n\\nThe emFileWait property is an integer that let our program retry if an EMFILE error is encountered. It is the maximum number of milliseconds that we wait to try deleting the directory again. The rmdir function will retry every 1ms until the emFileWait value is reached. Default value is 1000.\\n\\nThe maxBusyTries is an integer is the number of retries when the EBUSY , ENOTEMPTY or EPERM error is encountered. It will retry every 100 milliseconds up to the maxBusyTries value.\\n\\nThe recursive property is a boolean property.

In recursive mode, errors aren’t reported if path doesn’t exist and operations are retried on failure. The default value is false .\\n\\nRecursive mode is an experimental feature. It returns a promise which resolves with no argument when the directory removal operation succeeds. Using the promise version of the rmdir function with files results in the promise being rejected with the ENOENT error on Windows and an ENOTDIR error on POSIX operating systems.\\n\\nWe can use it like in the following code:\\n\\nconst fsPromises = require(\"fs\").promises;\\n\\nconst dirToDelete = \"./files/deleteFolder\"; (async () => {\\n\\ntry {\\n\\nawait fsPromises.rmdir(dirToDelete, {\\n\\nemfileWait: 2000,\\n\\nmaxBusyTries: 5,\\n\\nrecursive: false\\n\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(\"Removal complete!\");\\n\\n} catch (error) {\\n\\nconsole.error(error);\\n\\n}\\n\\n})();\\n\\nThe directory with the given path should be gone when the code above is run if it exists and it’s not being used by other programs. We used the try...catch block to catch errors with the async and await syntax with the promise version of the rmdir .\\n\\nThis is a better choice than rmdirSync for running sequential operations because asynchronous operations like promises won’t hold up the program’s execution when it’s running, which means that other parts of the program can run if the operation isn’t finished.\\n\\nWe renamed items stored on disk with the rename family of functions and remove directories with the rmdir family of functions.\\n\\nWith the rename family of functions, we just pass in the original path and the path that we want to rename to and then anything that’s passed in will be renamed if it’s valid.',\n",

              "   'An Intuitive Explanation of Gradient Descent\\n\\nGradient Descent is widely used in the machine learning world and is essentially an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a cost function. In data science, gradient descent is used to refine the parameters (coefficients) of our model to minimize error. We’ll go through an example below to understand how gradient descent works.\\n\\nImagine that the graph above represents the relationship between people’s height and weight; taller people generally weigh more than shorter people. Suppose we wanted to find the line of best fit, that is the equation that best represents the data shown above.\\n\\nThe image above shows that the (red) line of best fit on the left is much more precise than the one on the right. This can be seen by looking at the distance between each point and the line of best fit. The less distance there is (the less error), the better the line of best fit. The line of best fit is represented by the equation that we’ve all learned in high school, y = mx + b.\\n\\nTo understand gradient descent, we first need to understand what the cost function is.\\n\\nA cost function is essentially something that we want to minimize; in this case, we want to minimize the distance between the data points and the line of best fit. You can think of the cost function as an error function if that makes more sense intuitively. To understand the cost function, let’s use an even simpler example.\\n\\nSuppose we have data points that fall right on the line of best fix, y = x, where the slope is equal to 1. In this case, the distance between the data points and the line of best fit, aka the cost function, would be equal to zero.\\n\\nNow imagine that we move the line of best fit to the green line so that the slope is equal to 2 (green line). Now, the distance between the data points and the line of best fit has increased. This means that the cost function has increased. Similarly, if we moved the line of best fit so that the slope was equal to ½ (blue line), the cost function would have equally increased as the green line.\\n\\nIf we plot the slope of the line of best fit with the corresponding cost function, we can see that a slope of one minimizes the cost function, aka minimizes the distance between the data points and the line of best fit. And if you look back at our graph with a slope equal to 1, this is true!\\n\\nNow onto the fun stuff.\\n\\nGradient Descent is an algorithm that is used to essentially minimize the cost function; in our example above, gradient descent would tell us that a slope of one would give us the most precise line of best fit.\\n\\nWhile it looks daunting, it’s rather simple. Let me explain:\\n\\nθj is equal to m (the slope)\\n\\nα is equal to the learning rate (I’ll explain this more later)\\n\\n(∂/ ∂θj)*J(θ) is equal to the partial derivative of the cost function at point m (slope of the cost function, not the line of best fit)\\n\\nRepeat until convergence simply means repeating the algorithm until it reaches a global optimum (minimum in this case).\\n\\nIn words, this algorithm means:\\n\\nRepeatedly subtract the slope of the line of best fit by the slope of the cost function at point m times a coefficient (α) until the slope of the partial derivative is zero.\\n\\nNew slope = old slope of line of best fit — alpha * partial derivative of the cost function at point m\\n\\nTo show an example, let’s say we start with a line of best fit that has a slope of 2. If we look at the point with a slope of 2 on the cost function (the green point), we can take the partial derivative of that point aka the slope of the green line that is tangent to the curve. Here, we can see that the partial derivative is positive. Looking back at our equation,\\n\\nNew slope = old slope of line of best fit — alpha * partial derivative of the cost function at point m\\n\\nThe new slope (m) would be equal to 2 minus a positive number (since the partial derivative is positive), which would bring us to the red point (shown above).\\n\\nIf the partial derivation was negative aka, if the point started on the left side of the graph, then the new slope would be equal to the old slope minus a negative number, which is equivalent to the old slope plus a positive number.\\n\\nWe would repeat this process until we reach convergence, aka we reach a minimum, and thus we would have determined the slope of the line of best fit that minimizes the cost function!\\n\\nJust a quick note on alpha (α) in the gradient descent algorithm,\\n\\nIf α is too big, then the algorithm will overshoot each iteration (as shown in the left graph), which may inhibit it from reaching the minimum. Conversely, if α is too small, it will take too long to reach the minimum. Thus, α must be in between the two so that neither of these cases occur.\\n\\nAnd that’s gradient descent in a nutshell!',\n",

              "   \"We live in the world with a vast array of mobile devices, primarily dominated by two platforms: iOS and Android. It’s a two-horse race, and I’m sure we can all agree on that. Building a mobile application for both platforms is not an easy task, though.\\n\\nFor iOS, you write code using Objective-C or Swift, and for Android, you will find yourself using Java or Kotlin. Apart from different programming languages used to create an app that can run on each of the two platforms, the toolchains are entirely different.\\n\\nMany modern-day developers use a specific tech stack to build web applications: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Different frameworks fall under the category commonly known as hybrid frameworks. As such, you can use (almost) one set of source code for developing apps for both iOS and Android platforms.\\n\\nIn recent years, hybrid frameworks have evolved from using web views to use native APIs. The cross-platform approach for developing a mobile application comes with its own pros and cons.\\n\\nOne great option that falls under the umbrella of cross-platform development is React Native. It was developed and used by Facebook, and many others use it as well, including Tesla, Walmart, Uber Eats, Instagram, Discord, Wix, and more. React Native is based on Facebook’s web library ReactJS.\\n\\nWhat is this tutorial is about?\\n\\nReact Hooks have been available since the release of React version 16.8.x . In this tutorial, you’re going to receive a quick introduction on how to use them in a React Native app.\\n\\nThese functions allow using React state and a component’s lifecycle methods in a functional component. If you’re familiar with React, you know that the functional component has been called as a functional stateless component since the introduction of classes —but not anymore.\\n\\nPreviously, a class component allowed you to have a local state. Using React Hooks, there is no requirement to refactor a React Native class component into a functional component, only because you want to introduce local state or lifecycle methods in that component.\\n\\nHowever, they do not work with classes. React provides a few built-in Hooks such as useState and useEffect. You can also create your own Hooks to re-use, to manage state between different components.\\n\\nTable of contents\\n\\nGetting started\\n\\nThe entry point of a React Native app\\n\\nSetting up a stack navigation\\n\\nAdding the second screen to the stack navigator\\n\\nAdding a Floating Button component\\n\\nAdding a custom header component\\n\\nImplementing Hooks\\n\\nAdding a FlatList component to render notes\\n\\nUsing Navigation parameters to update the state\\n\\nRunning the app\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nGetting started\\n\\nTo quickly create a React Native app, let’s use a tool called Expo. It’s a managed development toolkit that provides a client to preview and make changes to React Native apps using JavaScript. You don’t need tools such as Xcode or Android Studio to get started.\\n\\nTo generate a new app, open a terminal window and enter the following command to install the command-line tool provided by Expo:\\n\\nThe next step is to run the expo init command and choose the default template: blank .\\n\\nOnce the project directory is generated, navigate inside it. The demo you’re going to build requires the use of a navigation pattern between two screens. The first screen is going to display a list of items, and through the second screen, you can add an item to the list. This is a typical stack navigation pattern, and using the react-navigation library, you can add this to your React Native app.\\n\\nThe react-navigation library is a third party library that needs to be installed in a React Native or Expo app separately as a dependency. You can either use npm or yarn , but I’m going to stick with yarn . Each navigational pattern comes as a dependency, too. Since this demo requires only one pattern, let’s install that, as well.\\n\\nThe third library you’re going to install is called react-native-paper , which will provide a collection of custom UI components based on Material Design that you can integrate directly. Go back to the terminal window and execute the following command:\\n\\nReact Navigation is made up of some core utilities, which are then used by navigators to create the navigation structure in your app. After the above step, Expo requires you to configure these core utilities as dependencies:\\n\\nThat’s all for the setup. Let’s build something.\\n\\nThe entry point of a React Native app\\n\\nThe App.js file in the generated app structure is what initializes the Expo app. In other words, it’s the entry point of the development process. By default, it displays a text message and uses a functional component for that. Open the App.js file, and you’ll get the following screen component file:\\n\\nComponents are the visual elements that you see on the screen in a React Native app. The three major components to look for in the above code snippet are:\\n\\nView\\n\\nText\\n\\nStyleSheet\\n\\nA View component is the basic building block in a React Native component file. It maps to fundamental native iOS ( UIView ) and Android ( View ) components, hence its name. It puts a container element that supports layout styling with flexbox and other styles using a JavaScript object called StyleSheet . Hence, it can be said that View components are primarily used for styling and the layout of children elements.\\n\\nThe StyleSheet component in React Native provides an API to create styles inside the component file. It takes a JavaScript object as it does above, and returns a new StyleSheet object from it. There are no classes or IDs in React Native like in web development. To create a new style object, you can use the StyleSheet.create() method.\\n\\nThe Text component is in many ways just like the View component, except that it’s specifically available to display text. Also, like the View component, it supports styling.\\n\\nTo see the default app in action, start the development server from the terminal window with expo start . Either using a simulator or a real device (make sure it has an Expo client installed from the app store), you can test the app.\\n\\nSetting up a stack navigation\\n\\nThe react-navigation-stack library provides a built-in function that returns a React component. This function, createStackNavigator , takes a route configuration object and an options object (which is optional).\\n\\nThe react-navigation library provides a function called createAppContainer that also returns a React component. It takes a React component created by the createStackNavigator as a parameter and is directly exported to App.js to be used as our app's root component.\\n\\nTo create the first route, you need to create the first screen. Create a new file called ViewNotes.js inside the src/screens directory. This screen is going to be served as the first or home screen of the app. Right now, let’s add some mock components, and later we’ll add UI component to reflect the demo app.\\n\\nNext, create a new file called index.js inside src/navigation/ with the following code snippet:\\n\\nIn the above code snippet, the parameters such as initialRouteName and headerMode are passed as the optional object properties. The first object contains the route configuration.\\n\\nTo see this in action, open the App.js file, import the navigator created above as well as the PaperProvider component from react-native-paper . This provider is going to wrap the navigator and provides the theme to all the components in the framework:\\n\\nMake sure the development server is running. You’re going to get the following output in the Expo client.\\n\\nAdding the second screen to the stack navigator\\n\\nTo complete the navigation process, let’s set up the other screen with some mock text to display. Inside src/screens/ , create another file called AddNotes.js and add the following code snippet:\\n\\nOpen the navigation/index.js file and modify the stack navigator:\\n\\nDo note that in the options object, you can specify a mode property for the stack navigator. The value of this property is used to define a specific way to render styles and transitions. The default value of this property is card for screen transitions in iOS and Android. In the above snippet, add the property with a value of modal .\\n\\nA modal is like a popup that displays the content but temporarily blocks the interaction from the primary screen, which in this case is the ViewNotes screen. To access the second screen, you still have to add a way to navigate to it.\\n\\nAdding a Floating Button component\\n\\nreact-native-paper also provides cross-platform components to add to the app. In this section, let’s add a floating button on the ViewNotes screen that can be used to navigate to the AddNotes screen. Import the component from the UI library:\\n\\nNext, modify the return function and a FAB component as well as corresponding styles to position it at the bottom of the screen.\\n\\nIn the Expo client, you’re going to get the following output:\\n\\nAlso, when you click the FAB button, it will navigate you to the AddNotes screen:\\n\\nThis is done by using navigation props from react-navigation . Using navigation.navigate as the value of the button press prop onPress , the app will navigate to the screen with its name passed as the second parameter.\\n\\nAdding a custom header component\\n\\nIn this section, let’s build a custom header component that’s reusable for both of the screens currently residing in the app. Inside the directory src/components/ , create a new file called Header.js .\\n\\nImport the following components from react-native and react-native-paper :\\n\\nThe Appbar is a component that displays items in a bar. Each of the items can have an action associated, but for the demo app, you only need it to display a title. Add the following code snippet that consists of the component as well as the corresponding styles. The Header component is going to accept one prop titleText , which is the title of a specific screen.\\n\\nImport this component in ViewNotes.js and modify the contents of the component file in order to display the header.\\n\\nThe following is going to be the output:\\n\\nSimilarly, modify the AddNotes.js file:\\n\\nHere’s the output:\\n\\nImplementing Hooks\\n\\nTo clearly understand how functional components can be leveraged to manage a state’s component, let’s try to go through one of the most basic examples by leveraging one of the few built-in Hooks: useState .\\n\\nOpen the ViewNotes.js file and start by importing useState from the React library:\\n\\nLet’s create an array to store and display all the notes. Using the array later as the value to the FlatList component, you can easily render each note. In a functional component, you can define a default state variable as shown below:\\n\\nReact preserves the state between all the re-rendering that happens. The Hook useState returns a pair of values. In the above snippet, the first one is notes , which holds the current value of an empty array (by default) and the second, setNotes , is a function that lets you update the current value, or in the our case, add items to the array.\\n\\nTo add items to the array, let’s create a helper method called addNotes .\\n\\nAdding a FlatList component to render notes\\n\\nWhen the array notes is empty, we can display a text message that indicates that there’s no item in the list; otherwise, we can render a FlatList component. To do this, you have to import the component itself first.\\n\\nThe component FlatList is an efficient way to create scrolling data lists in a React Native app. It has a simple API and is more efficient and performant, with a large amount of information to display in comparison to its alternatives.\\n\\nNext, modify the JSX of the ViewNotes component. Do take note that when navigating to the AddNotes screen, you have to pass it as a prop. This can be done by passing it as the second parameter to the navigation.navigate function.\\n\\nFrom the above snippet, observe that there are three primary props that a FlatList component requires to display a list of data:\\n\\ndata : an array of data used to create a list. Generally, this array is built from multiple objects.\\n\\n: an array of data used to create a list. Generally, this array is built from multiple objects. renderItem : a function that takes an individual element from the data array and renders it on the UI.\\n\\n: a function that takes an individual element from the data array and renders it on the UI. keyExtractor : tells the list of data to use the unique identifiers or ID for an individual element.\\n\\nAlso, add the listTitle inside the StyleSheet object:\\n\\nUsing navigation parameters to update the state\\n\\nSince there are no notes, for now, let’s modify the AddNotes screen to make it functional. This screen is responsible for adding a note to the ViewNotes screen. Start by modifying the existing import statements:\\n\\nUsing the Hook useState , the component is going to hold the value of each note's title and its description as noteTitle and noteValue , respectively.\\n\\nThe IconButton component from react-native-paper is going to be used to close the modal. After that, add two input fields using TextInput that are going to take the user value for the title of the note and its description.\\n\\nLastly, using a FAB component, the user can submit the form. This component is going to be temporarily disabled if there’s no title provided for the note. This can be done by using the disabled prop.\\n\\nOn clicking this button, the component using navigation props is going to perform two actions simultaneously. It’s going to save the note's title and its description as well as perform an action to go back to the ViewNotes screen.\\n\\nHere’s the complete AddNotes code snippet along with corresponding styles.\\n\\nAnd here’s the output you’re going to get when navigating to the AddNotes screen:\\n\\nRunning the app\\n\\nThe demo app is complete and ready to be tested. In the Expo client image below, you can find a demo for adding a note and rendering the note:\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIf you’re getting started with React Native development, Expo as a toolkit can serve you well on your journey. Instead of digging too much into iOS and Android development setup, which can be overwhelming at the start, I’d recommend the least possible amount of tooling and lean more towards learning the core APIs and fundamentals of React Native.\\n\\nThe way that Expo is being maintained, with added support for web and universal apps, it’s going to be an important part of the journey.\\n\\nYou can checkout the next post in this series to implement React Hooks with Redux state management library here:\",\n",

              "   'Background\\n\\nSince the previous Summer of Hacks events had taken place way back in 2016, I and Rich Douglas, both enterprising members of the Digital Oxford community, decided to try and run it again in 2019. It took a lot of planning, and we’re hoping that the materials and schedules we put together will be useful (and cut down on planning time) during the next iteration. Most helpfully, we also formed a very productive relationship with the Oxfordshire County Public Library which we will definitely be building upon in the future.\\n\\nIn this quick look back, we’ll be explaining the schedule of events and what we hoped to achieve from each of them, as well as detail the lessons learnt and next steps going forward. The first port of call would probably be the website.\\n\\nAt the outset, we decided that we wanted to set up something that would be useful for the community, explicitly applicable to a range of skill levels, and that could be leveraged as a way to learn new skills or build on existing ones. We were also interested in leveraging our existing relationships within the Digital Oxford community to help build more lasting links with the less technical side of Oxford (businesses, artists, designers, etc).\\n\\nThe first big win we got was finding a great venue. We were excited when it turned out that the Oxfordshire County Library was available, and it suited our needs perfectly. It was free, well-organised for events, and Mark the librarian was extremely helpful. We worked very closely with him to set up our events, and it’s largely thanks to his work, as well as other library staff, that the events went off as well as they did.\\n\\nWe also would like to give a big thank you to Haybrook IT (https://www.haybrook.co.uk/), the sponsors for the entire series of events, providing food and refreshments for all participants. They are long-time supporters of the Digital Oxford community, and we couldn’t have done it without their assistance.\\n\\nNodeSchool\\n\\nAdam and Mark\\n\\nOur first event was NodeSchool, targeted at beginning javascript developers who wanted to get more familiarity with this (typically) server-side language. It follows along with a free worldwide course, and although it features a multitude of different offerings for various skill levels, we were aiming at introducing attendees to the basic ones, with the idea that they would be able to follow successive courses on their own as and when they chose.\\n\\nThere was a great turnout on the day (17 at last count), and lots of different skill levels. It turned out that a lot of participants needed fundamental JS skills rather than jumping straight into node, which was something that we hadn’t anticipated, but not actually that surprising.\\n\\nAs a general theme to these events, we experienced participation from a much wider section of the community that just those engaged in programming, and this was very encouraging to see, as it validated our assumptions that this series of events could function as a bridge to engage those beyond the existing Digital Oxford community.\\n\\nAs one consequence of this, we decided midway through the session to amend the programme and present an impromptu workshop/discussion on Git and associated concepts. This was welcomed by all participants, as source control for code was something that many of them had passing familiarity with, but had never had the chance to engage with in a deeper, more practical way.\\n\\nHardware Hackday\\n\\nclappy bird (patent pending)\\n\\nOur second event involved using (primarily, though not necessarily) javascript to interact with hardware such as lights, motors and other mechanical devices. There were a similar number of participants to the first event, though much more variation in terms of motivations. Some of the attendees had existing projects that they were interested in working on, while others had come along to see what using software to interact with hardware was all about.\\n\\nThis event, compared to the other two, was the biggest hit with younger participants, and featured such projects as getting robots to draw on paper, using lights to simulate train service status, and exploiting a pressure sensor to interact with video games. It’s fair to say that all participants, no matter their level of experience, enjoyed the event, and came away with a better idea of things they could do with hardware.\\n\\nGordon Williams of Espruino fame and Carlos Perate were both awesome mentors on the day, happy to answer questions and pair with folks on their hacks.\\n\\nThe library’s MakerSpace was particularly well placed to support this event: it had tons of hackable hardware available for us to use including Makey Makey kits and Raspberry Pis.\\n\\nLanguage Hackday\\n\\nDan using NLP to analyse BBC subtitles\\n\\nOur third and final event is one that was very close to my personal interests, aimed at using software to interact with any sort of language resources (in audio or video format). It was admittedly an extremely broad remit, though this was mostly a consequence of not being able to find any examples of similar events ever being held (on the internet, ever!). So it was hoped that by being very broadly targeted, we would be able to accommodate the widest possible interests, and also get a better idea of what people were actually interested in.\\n\\nIt turned out that the day became a bit more like an overview of what could be achieved with NLP technologies. A few of the attendees had existing projects they wanted to work on, while others just tried to install tensorflow (which is a vast topic and could use its own hackday). While this was our least attended event, it was still full of lively discussion and experimentation, and the participants definitely left with a better idea of some common applications of computers in the general area of language.\\n\\nIn contrast to the other two events, there were a number of participants who were interested in the general area because they interact with other team members who use NLP, not necessarily because they themselves are expecting to need to use it. This was very encouraging, as it showed a level of interest in the wider community that perhaps might be addressed by more focused events in the future.\\n\\nFuture Directions\\n\\nOne thing that is absolutely undeniable, is that this series of events provided an abundance of good interaction between us, the library and the community. Going forward, there are incredible opportunities to refine the offerings for the event schedule, and leverage the resources such as the Oxfordshire County Library and its staff to yield stronger engagement with the local community.\\n\\nThough we hadn’t initially conceived it as such, the series of events could easily be refocused as a more explicit link between programmers with particular skills and those interested in leveraging those skills to fulfil business needs. In addition, it was clear that discussions, particularly between designers and developers, that took place on the day were fruitful and resulted in greater engagement within the community.\\n\\nAs another lesson, we definitely need to spend more time creating differentiated materials suitable for a wider span of experience and skill levels. The advantage of doing this is two-fold: we’d have them available on the day to accommodate those turning up who might be different to our expected target audience, and since these materials will live on in digital form, we only have to create them once. This would be the biggest step towards improving the event experience for participants.\\n\\nAnother aspect that we stand to build on is a sense of what to do next, after the event has ended. While there are certainly a wealth of materials available online, we could easily curate these a bit and make possible next steps more explicit for attendees. Further, having contacts in the local community who would be interested in making practical usage of these skills would be a natural extension of the work done on the day itself.\\n\\nIn addition, those that are interested in moving forward in becoming software developers themselves would be able to use the events not only as skill-building exercises, but also as networking opportunities to support their journey towards becoming professionals in the industry.\\n\\nOur biggest update to the event series is for next year’s Summer of Hacks events to fold into the library’s existing Digital Summer program. This will deepen our collaboration with the library and the community that the library fosters through its various digital programs — FreeCodeCamp, CodeBar, CodeClub — and provide an obvious pathway to supporting folks beyond the one-day events. We were greatly impressed by the library and its staff during this Summer’s events, and we are very keen to exploit them as a resource in future community events.\\n\\n*Last words\\n\\nMark the brilliant and talented librarian\\n\\nOverall, we were exceedingly pleased with the event series, look forward to hosting them again next year in a bigger and better iteration, and plan to announce the 2020 Summer of Hacks events in the new year.\\n\\nOnce again, an enormous thank you to Oxfordshire County Library, Mark Sutcliffe, and Haybrook IT!\\n\\nSee you next year.',\n",

              "   'AWS Lambda Logo\\n\\nAmazon Web Services — Lambda has become the go-to solution when it comes to serverless computing and rightfully so.\\n\\nCompared to it’s peers like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, AWS Lambda can run almost every popular language out there, namely Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, C#, Go and PowerShell. Not to forget, it has seamless integrations with a plethora of AWS services.\\n\\nRead the official documentation for more information.\\n\\nIf you merely read the brochure, going serverless seems like the obvious next step for your projects since it offers ease of deployments, hassle free infrastructure and cost benefits. However, things can easily go south if you are trying to use it at scale in your production applications.\\n\\nThis article outlines some of the right use-cases, best practices and things to avoid when using AWS Lambda for getting the most out of it.\\n\\nNote :- This article is targeted towards developers starting out in their careers or have just begun working with cloud solutions. I am assuming that you have a basic knowledge of AWS Lambda and have used it in some capacity.\\n\\nIs AWS Lambda right for you ?\\n\\nWhenever you are considering Lambda for your next big project,\\n\\nIt can be a great solution if your application is one OR all of the following :-\\n\\nA Web Application.\\n\\nA Restful API.\\n\\nA Mobile or an IOT application back-end.\\n\\nA Periodic/Event Driven Job that runs for a small duration. For example, image compression, data conversion and cleansing, change data capture, log analysis and data backups.\\n\\nLambda is not a good choice if your application is one OR all of the following :-\\n\\nA web-socket server.\\n\\nA Batch Processing Job that demands very high CPU or long execution times.\\n\\nRead the official documentation for case studies.\\n\\nUnderstand the Pricing\\n\\nAccording to the official Lambda documentation, AWS charges you basis on the number of requests and the duration of your functions. Sounds simple right ? It isn’t…\\n\\nLambda Pricing Explained\\n\\nNote :- All prices are for N.Virginia region and don’t take the Free-Tier usage into account.\\n\\nIf you allocated 128MB memory to your function and executed it 100,000 times in a month, and it ran for 1 second each time, your usage would be calculated as follows :-\\n\\nCompute Charges\\n\\nTotal Compute Seconds = 100,000 * 1 = 100,000 Seconds\\n\\nTotal Compute GB-seconds = 100,000 * 128/1024 = 12,500 GB-seconds\\n\\nCost = 12,500 * $0.00001667 = $0.20\\n\\nRequest Charges (Number of times your lambda is invoked)\\n\\nCost = $0.20 ($0.20 is charged for every 1 Million Requests)\\n\\nTotal Cost = $0.20 + $0.20 = $0.40\\n\\nWriting Serverless code that Works Great\\n\\nThe underlying implementation of lambda launches containers for running your code and destroys them once it’s done. This process is called a “Cold Start”.\\n\\nSince spinning up containers is a costly operation, if your lambda gets invoked often (usually once every 5 minutes), subsequent invocations processed by the same instance of your function can reuse the container. This is called a “Warm Start”.\\n\\nKeeping your Lambda “Warm” provides the following optimization opportunities :-\\n\\nIf you initialize SDK and database connections outside the function handler code, subsequent lambda invocations by the same container will not re-initialize them. Providing huge performance gains.\\n\\nAny files downloaded in the /tmp/ directory (limited to 512MB) during lambda invocation will persist through subsequent invocations by the same container.\\n\\nBest Practices for structuring your code :-\\n\\nWrite your application logic in a method outside your handler method and call it inside the handler . This makes it easier to unit test your application logic.\\n\\n. This makes it easier to unit test your application logic. Don’t store credentials and configurations inside your code . Instead, use environment variables in Lambda to separate your code from configuration.\\n\\n. Instead, use environment variables in Lambda to separate your code from configuration. Avoid using heavy packages and libraries with a large memory footprint or disk usage.\\n\\nwith a large memory footprint or disk usage. Use layers for shipping your code dependencies . Layers allow you to share common dependencies between multiple Lambdas, helps keep your deployment package size small, significantly reducing deployment time and makes your deployed lambda code editable from the AWS Lambda Console (very handy when you want to fix a production bug quickly).\\n\\n. Layers allow you to share common dependencies between multiple Lambdas, helps keep your deployment package size small, significantly reducing deployment time and makes your deployed lambda code editable from the AWS Lambda Console (very handy when you want to fix a production bug quickly). Write Unit Tests and test your code locally before deploying it to Lambda. Input Stubs for handler code can be easily generated as AWS provides sample input data for all possible lambda integrations. Moreover, tools like Serverless allow lambda-like execution of your code locally.\\n\\nHacks for ensuring that your code runs on Lambda as expected :-\\n\\nDevelop locally using the language and version specified in your lambda configuration. For example, if your lambda is configured to run on Python-3.7, write and test your code in Python-3.7.\\n\\nAlways use virtual environment (venv or virtualenv) if you are using Python. Utilize Docker for all other languages. Isolation of environments goes a long way to making your code behaviour expected and stable.\\n\\nIf you are using a dynamic language like Node or Python, a quick and dirty way of discovering almost all import and syntax errors locally is by executing the file containing your handler code.\\n\\nFor example, if you are using python and index.py contains your handler function; simply run python index.py before you deploy your code.\\n\\nFor example, if you are using python and index.py contains your handler function; simply run python index.py before you deploy your code. If you are creating and uploading layers for your functions, ensure that contained libraries were built using the same language and version your Lambda is running on. Ignoring this will cause errors when using compiled libraries, for example, psyopg2 and confluent-kafka in Python.\\n\\nEssential security practices :-\\n\\nCreate One IAM Role per Lambda function. This Role should contain all the IAM Policies required to run your code and interact with other AWS services. Avoid sharing Roles between Lambdas.\\n\\nDon’t store AWS Credentials inside your code or environment variables. If a proper IAM Role is attached to your Lambda, you will be able to use AWS SDK like Boto3 without explicitly providing credentials.\\n\\nIf you must have your credentials in the code, you can utilize KMS for storing encrypted values and decrypting them on-the-fly.\\n\\nLogging is your Friend, And your Biggest Enemy\\n\\nAll of us have had our fair share of debugging Lambda functions. Let’s admit it, it‘s’ not the easiest job in the world. Most developers end up logging the input data, the output data and everything in between.\\n\\nLambda writes all your logs to the CloudWatch Logs. This can work great for debugging your code in a development environment.\\n\\nDoing this in a production at a high scale can end up burning your pockets. Your CloudWatch costs will skyrocket and it might cost you more than your actual Lambda billing.\\n\\nIf you really must log everything, try using cheaper alternatives like ElasticSearch or store the logs on S3.\\n\\nDon’t Stress, just setup CloudWatch Alerts\\n\\nAs your organization grows, the number of Lambda functions in use could get out of hand and unmanageable. Even for a team of seasoned developers using the latest tools, monitoring all your Lambdas real-time is daunting.\\n\\nA simple way to be stress-free is to setup alerts on 3 key parameters for each of your lambda. Throttles, Errors and Timeouts.\\n\\nSetting up CloudWatch Alerts is easy and cheap. You will no longer need to stare at your Lambda Consoles for monitoring.\\n\\nUse Versioning for A-B Testing and Quick Roll-back\\n\\nYou can use versions to manage the deployment of your AWS Lambda functions. For example, you can publish a new version of a function for beta testing without affecting users of the stable production version.\\n\\nThe system creates a new version of your Lambda function each time that you publish the function. The new version is a copy of the unpublished version of the function. The function version includes the following information:\\n\\nThe function code and all associated dependencies.\\n\\nThe Lambda runtime that executes the function.\\n\\nAll of the function settings, including the environment variables.\\n\\nA unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to identify this version of the function.\\n\\nRead the Official Documentation for more details.\\n\\nSqueeze every bit of Performance\\n\\nAWS Documentation states that Lambda allocates CPU power linearly in proportion to the amount of memory configured. At 1,792 MB, a function has the equivalent of 1 full vCPU (one vCPU-second of credits per second).\\n\\nThis feature of Lambda is not very well documented and is still shrouded in mystery. Multiple independent studies and comments from Amazon Spokespersons revealed that Lambdas with more than 1.8GB of memory are multi core; and multi-threaded or multi-process code is needed to take advantage of the additional performance.\\n\\nIf your Lambda code is compute intensive, it will benefit you from running your code multi-threaded and playing around with memory configurations to find the sweet spot. Your ideal configuration should minimize your costs.\\n\\nHere is a great article I found which explains how AWS allocates virtual processors to your Lambda functions based on memory configurations :-\\n\\nhttps://engineering.opsgenie.com/how-does-proportional-cpu-allocation-work-with-aws-lambda-41cd44da3cac\\n\\nBottom-line\\n\\nAlthough, AWS Lambda is an easy-to-use service and is being adopted at a staggering rate. Using it efficiently for production environments at high scale requires some discipline and expertise.\\n\\nMost of the information in this article is available freely on the internet and some of it reflects my opinions based on the challenges I faced while using Lambdas.\\n\\nThis article is not meant to be an exhaustive list of best practices for using AWS Lambda.\\n\\nRemember, mistakes can be reduced but can never be eliminated.',\n",

              "   'Hi everyone! In this blog post, I want to explain to you all about my understanding of clean code and how I implemented it in the software engineering project.\\n\\nWhat is Clean Code?\\n\\nClean Code\\n\\nClean code is subjective and each developer has a personal opinion. There are some ideas that are considered as the best practices and what constitutes a clean code, however, there is no determined, distinctive definition of what clean code is.\\n\\nIn my opinion, after reading a few books and articles about clean code, clean code can be summarized into one sentence, which is: clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change.\\n\\nEasy to understand means that the code is easy to read, whether the reader is the author of the code or someone else. The meaning of the code is clear so it minimizes the need for guesswork and possibility for misunderstandings. The code is also easy to understand on every level, such as:\\n\\nIt is easy to understand the execution flow of the entire application.\\n\\nIt is easy to understand how different objects collaborate with each other.\\n\\nIt is easy to understand the role and responsibility of each class.\\n\\nIt is easy to understand what each method does.\\n\\nIt is easy to understand what is the purpose of each expression and variable.\\n\\nEasy to change means that the code is easy to extend and refactor, and it is easy to fix bugs in the codebase. This can be achieved if the person making the changes understands the code and also feels confident that the changes introduced in the code do not break any existing functionality. For the code to be easy to change, there are some ways to do it, such as:\\n\\nClasses and methods are small and only have a single responsibility.\\n\\nClasses have clear and concise public APIs.\\n\\nClasses and methods are predictable and work as expected.\\n\\nThe code is easily testable and has unit tests (or it is easy to write the tests).\\n\\nTests are easy to understand and easy to change.\\n\\nSome Best Practices of Clean Code\\n\\nBest Practices of Clean Code\\n\\nMeaningful Names\\n\\nThe name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions.

Here is the most important thing to understand: The communication SIGNAL is ANALOG, but the MODULATION is DIGITAL.\\n\\nWhy is the signal analog?\\n\\nA) Our world is analog. Signals are electromagnetic waves which are inherently analog. This can’t be changed.\\n\\n2. What is modulation and why do we need it?\\n\\nA) Modulation is embedding a message signal onto a CARRIER signal.\\n\\nB) In the early days, the ‘message’ was voice. If everyone is trying to transmit their signal, we couldn’t hear it due to interference with every other message…. like being in a crowded room with everyone talking at once and trying to listen to a conversation across the room.\\n\\nC) The ‘message’ is placed onto a CARRIER signal. The carrier is a signal (sinusoid) at a given frequency (channel) and the information is MODULATED onto the carrier. This keeps everyone’s signal from interfering if each conversation is on a separate channel.\\n\\n3. What is analog vs. digital modulation?\\n\\nA) Analog modulation was used first because it was easy. We had an analog signal and on the other end we wanted an analog signal. The most simplistic approach was to use AMPLITUDE MODULATION (AM). The voice message was used to change the amplitude of the carrier signal.\\n\\nB) Digital modulation uses BINARY format to change the PHASE or FREQUENCY of the carrier in discrete steps (1 or 0 as in the binary number representation). That is, the frequency of the carrier will be changed by +/- some small frequency offset based on the binary message. In reality the phase is modulated but frequency may be easier to visualize and is very close.\\n\\n4. Why is everything going to digital modulation over analog modulation?\\n\\nA) Digital modulation is more robust. If the signal is AM modulated, then any interference or noise is added directly to the signal… so it sounds like it has ‘static’ in it.\\n\\nB) Then systems went to FM instead of AM. FM = Frequency Modulation. This is still an analog modulation, but interference is far less likely to create frequency errors than amplitude errors. The FM signal can still sound like there is ‘static’ but not nearly as likely. That’s why FM sounds better than AM.\\n\\nC) Digital modulation only has to be accurate enough to decode the message into a 1 or 0. High or low. So, the digital modulation is extremely robust to noise and interference… but when it breaks, it is a brick wall. It sounds great until it breaks. This can be seen if you have watched an HDTV broadcast over the air. It looks awesome until the signal degrades (storm, bad antenna, etc.) and then you see large ‘pixelation’ and it flashes in and out completely as you begin to see the pixelation.',\n",

              "   'Introduction\\n\\nMVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface be it via a markup language or GUI code from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model). The view model of MVVM is a value converter, meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. In this respect, the view model is more model than a view, and handles most if not all of the view’s display logic. The view model may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we will try to define each component of the MVVM pattern in order to create a small android app that respects this pattern.\\n\\nThe image below show different element that we are going to create by using Architecture component and Koin as Dependency Injection library.\\n\\nThe architecture below can be divided into 3 different part\\n\\nView\\n\\nIt contains the structural definition of what users will have on the screen. You can put static and dynamic content (animations and change states). It must not contain any application logic in our case the view can be an activity or a fragment.\\n\\nView Model\\n\\nThis component links the model and the view. He is in charge of managing data links and possible conversions. This is where binding comes in. In Android, we don’t worry about it because we can directly use AndroidViewModel class or ViewModel.\\n\\nModel\\n\\nIt is the business data layer and is not linked to any specific graphical representation. In Android, according to the clean architecture, the model can contain the room database, the repository and all other Business Logic Class.\\n\\nThe picture below can summarize the interaction between different component\\n\\nHow to implement the MVVM pattern\\n\\nIn order to implement the MVVM pattern, it’s very important to begin with the components that no need another component to work.\\n\\nSince the arrival of the architecture component, it is common to implement Android applications by following the model in the image below, as you can see the arrows are pointing from the view (activity/fragment) to the model.\\n\\nThis means that the View knows the View-Model but the View-Model has no reference to the View, the View Model knows the Model but the Model has no reference to the View-Model, In the nutshell the view will have a reference to the view-model but not the other way around and the view-model will have a reference to the model but not the other way around.\\n\\nThis architecture makes the application maintainable and testable.\\n\\nTo develop quickly and efficiently you have to start with the model because the model will not need the other components to work.\\n\\nApplication scenario and Model implementation\\n\\nTo understand the functioning of the MVVM pattern we will develop a small application that will contain all the components to be used in the previous image.\\n\\nWe will create an application that will display the data coming from this link, the application will save the data locally to allow the application to run on offline mode.\\n\\nUser Model\\n\\nThe application will handle data with this structure and for simplicity’s sake I only chose some properties\\n\\nThe GithubUser class has Room annotation since the data in the local database will have the same structure as the data from the API',\n",

Interaction with strangers was mostly limited to instant messengers and chat rooms, so it was easy to create an online persona that was nothing like your “in real life” self.\\n\\nThis drastically changed with the rise of social media. Even though the term “in real life” (IRL for short) suggests that our digital lives are different from our actual lives, social media no longer allows that. Our online selves and our real selves must now be one in the same. It is expected from our followers. You can no longer make up who you are. Followers want authenticity.\\n\\n“Both public opinion and the law are in agreement: What you post on social media — even if it’s anonymous and non-threatening — has repercussions. These days, you are what you tweet,” wrote Jack Morse, the author of the article “It’s a mistake to think that our online lives and IRL lives are separate.”\\n\\nThere have been multiple cases that a tweet or Facebook post have caused the original posters to lose their jobs and their followers.\\n\\nUltimately, we choose to be on social media and expose ourselves to all its drawbacks.\\n\\nWhile Morse’s article is aimed at individuals, businesses are also susceptible to all of the internet’s drawbacks. Behind any business social media account is an individual, and that person can make mistakes on behalf on an entire company. This is especially important now with the current climate of “outrage culture,” where anything an individual or company says can cause negative damage inadvertently.\\n\\nIn order to keep followers happy and engaged, it is imperative that those involved in managing social media accounts for personal reasons or for a business need to be educated and stay in-the-know of what’s socially acceptable and always post on brand.\\n\\nFollowers now expect for brand messages to be in line with company values, so essentially having their IRL values match their online messages.\\n\\nA direct link to the article can be found here: https://mashable.com/article/what-you-do-online-impacts-your-real-life/\\n\\nNote: This post was created as an assignment for my Social Media Management class at the University of Florida.',\n",

That in turn contributes to anxiety, depression or other mental health issues that can effect consumers. According to research, the reason for that is because of increased exposure to “idealized” images of individuals or life in general.\\n\\nInstagram’s “like” system is what plays a large effect on teenage girl consumers of the app. Science suggests that when someone, in particular teenage girls, see a post of another individual with more likes on their content, their brain associates that post with being the better of the two. Instagram attracts more girl than boy users, making teenage girls that much more vulnerable to the possible negative effects the app can create.\\n\\nAnother thing on the app that is harmful to teenage girls is the amount of influencers on Instagram and the prominence they hold on the app. Research says that the average American girl spends around 6–10 hours on social media a day being pushed products by influencers that may not be necessary for them.\\n\\nInstagram will likely continue to grow and still have a large amount of teenage consumers. Neuroscience has now shown that the app can have negative effects on teenage girls who use the app and should be something parents take seriously. Believe it or not, especially in today’s society, social media effects the well being of people.',\n",

Because my family only ordered the English tabloid once a week which severely limited my ability to have continues adventures with Peter Parker as both Spiderman and a photographer for the Daily Bugle.\\n\\nWhat was exciting was enjoying the random standalone strip: Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes and if I’m up for a challenge, a round of Sudoko, which I almost never complete (successfully).\\n\\nFast forward to today, I can read every single issue of Spiderman, Batman, or my favourite Manga from a digitally handheld device, no longer bounded by the logistics of time.\\n\\nTrust me when I’ve said that I wasn’t bounded by time. Or at least it felt like I wasn’t until I was reminded by the glistening ray of sun creeping through the seams of my curtain that I’m going to need a lot of coffee to get through the day.\\n\\nThen I lurched down and out of the house, reliving my younger self by potentially neglecting dental hygiene once again.\\n\\nOh, how the advances of technology made everything accessible and convenient. While I was no longer being limited by the lack of convenience, I conveniently limited other aspects of my life “maximizing” the discovery of my new found gift.\\n\\nIt doesn't stop at just reading comics, it could be multiple episodes of the newest Netflix recommendation, swarming my Safari browser with copious tabs of articles or spending time on Instagram giving people hearts even Cupid would salute in awe.\\n\\nIt never stops, not until you decide you want it to.\\n\\nOr you might have received a rude awakening when your partner complains that your eyes are always glued to the screen of your mobile device. Or the combination of the smell of burnt toast and the ringing of the smoke alarm knocks you out of that digital trance.\\n\\nEither scenario resulted in a similar outcome, the cessation of your digital dependance. Only the latter required an outside prompt, one that isn’t too pleasant whereas the former required an inner realization that this compulsion is getting virulent.\\n\\nChange can be driven by a rude awakening that might not be too pleasant or it can stem from an inner realisation that a compulsion is getting virulent\\n\\nPersonally, it took the combination of both scenarios and some “signs from the universe” for m e to put my foot down.\\n\\nIn the next couple of posts, I’ll write about the reasons why I’ve decided to reduce digitality, the steps I took, tips I found helpful and my current journey of not allowing technology to takeover (stay away Skynet), so stay tuned for the next post!\",\n",

I watched the movie Songcatcher recently again and was struck by the fictional story of an effort to catch, before lost forever, the voices of the mountain people of Appalachia. While the story of Lily Penlaric is not based on truth, it is grounded in the real story of Olive Dame Campbell who ventured into the mountains with her preacher husband in the early 1900s. She found herself delighted and entranced by the music, stories, crafts and culture of hardscrabble mountain folks. When British musicologist, Cecil Sharp published many of the tunes she had captured, the music of the mountains became known to the outside world.\\n\\nThe songs of Appalachia tell stories, poetic narrative of themes of communities stretching back in time. Of these mountain songs, many are lost, but some still are part of our culture of folk music. These songs belonged to the women, and it was through mothers, daughters, and granddaughters that the music was passed forward across time, carried forward through the roots of those whose voices- the Scots-Irish, English, Germans- settled the southern mountains.\\n\\nI read earlier a brief piece speaking to the ephemeral history of that which we have labeled as web 1.0 and 2.0. Someone commented to me recently that social media may only hold our words, our videos, our links, our stories, our conversations for a few short moments, weeks, or years until the media vanishes like a song echoing across a mountain hollow. Bookmarks that were active yesterday disappear today. We build circles of friends not knowing whether we will wake up to find that they have vanished from spaces that no longer exist in the virtual landscapes and communities of the web.\\n\\nI wonder if someone one day will become a songcatcher of the narratives we create in and about the virtual mountain communities we build today. Will anyone want to record our songs? Or will our songs disappear as the past overtakes our videos, our words, our recordings?

In her book Surveillance Capitalism, the Harvard social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff paints a picture of a world in which tech companies have constructed a massive system of surveillance that allows them to manipulate people’s attitudes, opinions and desires.\\n\\nIn each of these dystopian depictions, people are portrayed as powerless victims, robbed of their free will. Humans have become the playthings of manipulative algorithmic systems. But is this really true? Have the machines really taken over?\\n\\nIt is alleged that social media fuels polarization, exploits human weaknesses and insecurities, and creates echo chambers where everyone gets their own slice of reality, eroding the public sphere and the understanding of common facts. And, worse still, this is all done intentionally in a relentless pursuit of profit.\\n\\nAt the heart of many of the concerns is an assumption that in the relationship between human beings and complex automated systems, we are not the ones in control. Human agency has been eroded. Or, as Joanna Stern declared in the Wall Street Journal in January, we’ve “lost control of what we see, read — and even think — to the biggest social-media companies.”\\n\\nDefenders of social media have often ignored or belittled these criticisms — hoping that the march of technology would sweep them aside, or viewing the criticisms as misguided. This is a mistake: Technology must serve society, not the other way around. Faced with opaque systems operated by wealthy global companies, it is hardly surprising that many assume the lack of transparency exists to serve the interests of technology elites and not users. In the long run, people are only going to feel comfortable with these algorithmic systems if they have more visibility into how they work and then have the ability to exercise more informed control over them.\\n\\nCompanies like Facebook need to be frank about how the relationship between you and their major algorithms really works. And they need to give you more control.\\n\\nSome critics seem to think social media is a temporary mistake in the evolution of technology — and that once we’ve come to our collective senses, Facebook and other platforms will collapse and we’ll all revert to previous modes of communication. This is a profound misreading of the situation — as inaccurate as the December 2000 Daily Mail headline declaring the internet “may just be a passing fad.” Even if Facebook ceased to exist, social media won’t be — can’t be — uninvented. The human impulse to use the internet for social connection is profound.\\n\\nData-driven personalized services like social media have empowered people with the means to express themselves and to communicate with others on an unprecedented scale. And they have put tools into the hands of millions of small businesses around the world which were previously available only to the largest corporations. Personalized digital advertising not only allows billions of people to use social media for free, it is also more useful to consumers than untargeted, low-relevance advertising. Turning the clock back to some false sepia-tinted yesteryear — before personalized advertising, before algorithmic content ranking, before the grassroots freedoms of the internet challenged the powers that be — would forfeit so many benefits to society.\\n\\nBut that does not mean the concerns about how humans and algorithmic systems interact should be dismissed. There are clearly issues to be resolved and questions to be answered. The internet needs new rules — designed and agreed by democratically elected institutions — and technology companies need to make sure their products and practices are designed in a responsible way that takes into account their potential impact on society. That starts — but by no means ends — with putting people, not machines, more firmly in charge.\\n\\nIt Takes Two to Tango\\n\\nImagine you’re on your way home when you get a call from your partner. They tell you the fridge is empty and ask you to pick some things up on the way home. If you choose the ingredients, they’ll cook dinner. So you swing by the supermarket and fill a basket with a dozen items. Of course, you only choose things you’d be happy to eat — maybe you choose pasta but not rice, tomatoes but not mushrooms. When you get home, you unpack the bag in the kitchen and your partner gets on with the cooking — deciding what meal to make, which of the ingredients to use, and in what amounts. When you sit down at the table, the dinner in front of you is the product of a joint effort, your decisions at the grocery store and your partner’s in the kitchen.\\n\\nThe relationship between internet users and the algorithms that present them with personalized content is surprisingly similar. Of course, no analogy is perfect and it shouldn’t be taken literally. There are other people who do everything from producing the food to designing the packaging and arranging the supermarket shelves, all of whose actions impact the final meal.\\n\\nBut ultimately, content ranking is a dynamic partnership between people and algorithms. On Facebook, it takes two to tango.\\n\\nIn a recent speech, the Executive Vice President of the European Commission, Margrethe Vestager, compared social media to the movie The Truman Show. In it, Jim Carrey’s Truman has no agency. He is the unwitting star of a reality TV show, where his entire world is fabricated and manipulated by a television production company. But this comparison doesn’t do justice to users of social media. You are an active participant in the experience.\\n\\nThe personalized “world” of your News Feed is shaped heavily by your choices and actions. It is made up primarily of content from the friends and family you choose to connect to on the platform, the Pages you choose to follow, and the Groups you choose to join. Ranking is then the process of using algorithms to order that content.\\n\\nThis is the magic of social media, the thing that differentiates it from older forms of media. There is no editor dictating the frontpage headline millions will read on Facebook. Instead, there are billions of front pages, each personalized to our individual tastes and preferences, and each reflecting our unique network of friends, Pages, and Groups.\\n\\nPersonalization is at the heart of the internet’s evolution over the last two decades. From searching on Google, to shopping on Amazon, to watching films on Netflix, a key feature of the internet is that it allows for a rich feedback loop in which our preferences and behaviors shape the service that is provided to us. It means you get the most relevant information and therefore the most meaningful experience. Imagine if, instead of presenting recommendations based on things you’ve watched, Netflix simply listed the thousands upon thousands of movies and shows in order of those most watched. Where would you even start?\\n\\nWhen you think of how you experience Facebook, what you probably think of first is what you see on your News Feed. This is essentially Facebook’s front page, personalized to you: the vertical display of text, images, and videos that you scroll down once you open the Facebook app on your phone or log into facebook.com on your computer. The average person has thousands of posts they potentially could see at any given time, so to help you find the content you’ll find most meaningful or relevant, we use a process called ranking, which orders the posts in your Feed, putting the things we think you will find most meaningful closest to the top. The idea is that this results in content from your best friend being placed high in your Feed, while content from an acquaintance you met several years ago will often be much lower down.\\n\\nEvery piece of content that could potentially feature — including the posts you haven’t seen from your friends, the Pages you follow, and Groups you joined — goes through the ranking process. Thousands of signals are assessed for these posts, like who posted it, when, whether it’s a photo, video or link, how popular it is on the platform, or the type of device you are using. From there, the algorithm uses these signals to predict how likely it is to be relevant and meaningful to you: for example, how likely you might be to “like” it or find that viewing it was worth your time. The goal is to make sure you see what you find most meaningful — not to keep you glued to your smartphone for hours on end. You can think about this sort of like a spam filter in your inbox: it helps filter out content you won’t find meaningful or relevant, and prioritizes content you will.\\n\\nBefore we credit “the algorithm” with too much independent judgment, it is of course the case that these systems are designed by people. It is Facebook’s decision makers who ultimately decide what content is acceptable on the platform. Facebook has detailed Community Standards, developed over many years, that prohibit harmful content — and invests heavily in developing ways of identifying it and acting on it quickly.\\n\\nOf course, whether Facebook draws the line in the right place, or according to the right considerations, is a matter of legitimate public debate. And it is entirely reasonable to argue that private companies shouldn’t be making so many big decisions about what content is acceptable on their own. It would clearly be better if these decisions were made according to frameworks agreed by democratically accountable lawmakers. But in the absence of such laws, there are decisions that need to be made in real time.\\n\\nLast year, Facebook established an Oversight Board to make the final call on some of these difficult decisions. It is an independent body and its decisions are binding — they can’t be overruled by Mark Zuckerberg or anyone else at Facebook. Indeed, at the time of writing the Board has already overturned a majority of Facebook’s decisions referred to it. The board itself is made up of experts and civic leaders from around the world with a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives, and they began issuing judgments and recommendations earlier this year. The board is currently considering Facebook’s decision to indefinitely suspend former U.S. President Donald Trump in the wake of his inciting comments which contributed to the horrendous scenes at the Capitol.\\n\\nOther types of problematic content are addressed more directly through the ranking process. For example, there are types of content that might not violate Facebook’s Community Standards but are still problematic because users say they don’t like them. For these, Facebook reduces their distribution, as it does for posts deemed false by one of the more than 80 independent fact checking organizations that evaluate Facebook content. In other words, how likely a post is to be relevant and meaningful to you acts as a positive in the ranking process, and indicators that the post may be problematic (but non-violating) act as a negative. The posts with the highest scores after that are placed closest to the top of your Feed.\\n\\nThis sifting and ranking process results in a News Feed that is unique to you, like a fingerprint. But of course, you don’t see the algorithm at work, and you have limited insight into why and how the content that appears was selected and what, if anything, you could do to alter it. And it is in this gap in understanding that assumptions, half-truths, and misrepresentations about how Facebook works can take root.\\n\\nWhere Does Facebook’s Incentive Lie?\\n\\nCentral to many of the charges by Facebook’s critics is the idea that its algorithmic systems actively encourage the sharing of sensational content and are designed to keep people scrolling endlessly. Of course, on a platform built around people sharing things they are interested in or moved by, content that provokes strong emotions is invariably going to be shared. At one level, the fact that people respond to sensational content isn’t new. As generations of newspaper sub-editors can attest, emotive language and arresting imagery grab people’s attention and engage them. It’s human nature. But Facebook’s systems are not designed to reward provocative content. In fact, key parts of those systems are designed to do just the opposite.\\n\\nFacebook reduces the distribution of many types of content — meaning that content appears lower in your News Feed — because they are sensational, misleading, gratuitously solicit engagement, or are found to be false by our independent fact checking partners. For example, Facebook demotes clickbait (headlines that are misleading or exaggerated), highly sensational health claims (like those promoting “miracle cures”), and engagement bait (posts that explicitly seek to get users to engage with them).\\n\\nFacebook’s approach goes beyond addressing sensational and misleading content post-by-post. When Pages and Groups repeatedly post some of these types of content to Facebook, like clickbait or misinformation, Facebook reduces the distribution of all the posts from those Pages and Groups. And where websites generate an extremely disproportionate amount of their traffic from Facebook relative to the rest of the internet, which can be indicative of a pattern of posting more sensational or spammy content, Facebook likewise demotes all the posts from the Pages run by those websites.\\n\\nFacebook has also adjusted other aspects of its approach to ranking, including fundamental aspects, in ways that would be likely to devalue sensational content. Since the early days of the platform, the company has relied on explicit engagement metrics — whether people “liked,” commented on, or shared a post — to determine which posts they would find most relevant. But the use of those metrics has evolved and other signals Facebook considers have expanded.\\n\\nIn 2018, Mark Zuckerberg announced that his product teams would focus not only on serving people the most relevant content but also on helping them have more meaningful social interactions — primarily by promoting content from friends, family, and groups they are part of over content from Pages they follow. The effect was to change ranking such that explicit engagement metrics would still play a prominent role in filtering the posts likely to be most relevant to you, but now with an extra layer of assessing which of those potentially relevant posts was also likely to be meaningful to you. In doing this, he recognized explicitly that this shift would lead to people spending less time on Facebook because Pages — where media entities, sports teams, politicians, and celebrities among others tend to have a presence — generally post more engaging though less meaningful content than, say, your mum or dad. The prediction proved correct, as the change led to a decrease of 50 million hours’ worth of time spent on Facebook per day, and prompted a loss of billions of dollars in the company’s market cap.\\n\\nThis shift was part of an evolution of Facebook’s approach to ranking content. The company has since diversified its approach, finding new ways to determine what content people find most meaningful, including asking them directly and then incorporating those responses into the ranking process. For example, Facebook uses surveys to learn which posts people feel are worth their time and then prioritizes posts predicted to fit that bill. Surveys are also used to better understand how meaningful different friends, Pages, and Groups are to people, and ranking algorithms are updated based on the responses. This approach gives a more complete picture of the types of posts people find most meaningful, assessing their experience outside the immediate reaction, including the immediate pull of any sensational content.\\n\\nFacebook is also in the relatively early stages of exploring whether and how to rank some important categories of content differently — like news, politics, or health — in order to make it easier to find posts that are valuable and informative. And last month it was announced that it is considering new steps to reduce the amount of political content — where sensationalism is no stranger — in News Feed in response to strong feedback from users that they want to see less of it overall. This follows Facebook’s recent decision to stop recommending civic and political groups in the US, which is now being expanded globally.\\n\\nThis evolution also applies to the Groups people join around shared interests or experiences. Facebook has taken significant steps to make these spaces safer, including restricting or removing members or groups that violate its Community Standards.\\n\\nFacebook recognizes there are times when it is in the wider interest of society for authoritative information about topical issues to be prioritized in your News Feed. But just as messages from doctors telling us to eat our vegetables or dentists reminding us to floss will never be as engaging as celebrity gossip or political punditry, Facebook understands that it needs to supplement the ranking process to help more people find authoritative information. Last year, it did just that, helping people find accurate, up-to-date information around both Covid-19 and the U.S. elections. In both cases Facebook created information hubs with links and resources from official sources, and promoted these at the top of people’s News Feeds. Both had huge reach — more than 600 million people clicked through to credible sources of information about Covid-19 via Facebook and Instagram, and an estimated 4.5 million Americans were helped to register to vote.\\n\\nThe reality is, it’s not in Facebook’s interest — financially or reputationally — to continually turn up the temperature and push users towards ever more extreme content.\\n\\nThe company’s long-term growth will be best served if people continue to use its products for years to come. If it prioritized keeping you online an extra 10 or 20 minutes, but in doing so made you less likely to return in the future, it would be self-defeating. And bear in mind, the vast majority of Facebook’s revenue comes from advertising. Advertisers don’t want their brands and products displayed next to extreme or hateful content — a point that many made explicitly last summer during a high-profile boycott by a number of household-name brands. Even though troubling content is a small proportion of the total (hate speech is viewed 7 or 8 times for every 10,000 views of content on Facebook), the protest showed that Facebook’s financial self-interest is to reduce it, and certainly not to encourage it or optimize for it.\\n\\nPolarization\\n\\nBut even if you agree that Facebook’s incentives do not support the deliberate promotion of extreme content, there is nonetheless a widespread perception that political and social polarization, especially in the United States, has grown because of the influence of social media. This has been the subject of swathes of serious academic research in recent years — the results of which are in truth mixed, with many studies suggesting that social media is not the primary driver of polarization after all, and that evidence of the ‘filter bubble’ effect is thin at best.\\n\\nResearch from Stanford last year looked in depth at trends in nine countries over 40 years, and found that in some countries polarization was on the rise before Facebook even existed, and in others it has been decreasing while internet and Facebook use increased. Other credible recent studies have found that polarization in the United States has increased the most among the demographic groups least likely to use the internet and social media, and data published in the EU suggests that levels of ideological polarization are similar whether you get your news from social media or elsewhere.\\n\\nA Harvard study ahead of the 2020 U.S. election found that election-related disinformation was primarily driven by elite and mass-media, not least cable news, and suggested that social media played only a secondary role. And research from both Pew in 2019 and the Reuters Institute in 2017 showed that you’re likely to encounter a more diverse set of opinions and ideas using social media than if you only engage with other types of media.\\n\\nSource: Pew Research Center (reprinted with permission)\\n\\nAn earlier Stanford study showed that deactivating Facebook for four weeks before the 2018 US elections reduced polarization on political issues but also led to a reduction of people’s news knowledge and attention to politics. However, it did not significantly lessen so-called “affective polarization,” which is a measure of someone’s negative feelings about the opposite party.\\n\\nWhat evidence there is simply does not support the idea that social media, or the filter bubbles it supposedly creates, are the unambiguous driver of polarization that many assert. One thing we do know is that political content is only a small fraction of the content people consume on Facebook — our own analysis suggests that in the U.S. it is as little as 6%. Last year, Halloween had twice the increase in posting we saw on Election Day — and that’s despite the fact that Facebook prompted people at the top of their News Feed to post about voting.\\n\\nHow to Train Your Algorithm\\n\\nUnlike the relationship between the couple cooking dinner — one shopping for ingredients, the other cooking — where both sides have a meaningful understanding of what they are putting in and getting out, the relationship between a user and an algorithm isn’t as transparent.\\n\\nThat needs to change. You should be able to better understand how the ranking algorithms work and why they make particular decisions, and you should have more control over the content that is shown to you. You should be able to talk back to the algorithm and consciously adjust or ignore the predictions it makes — to alter your personal algorithm in the cold light of day, through breathing spaces built into the design of the platform.\\n\\nTo better put this into practice, Facebook has launched a suite of product changes to help you more easily identify and engage with the friends and Pages you care most about. And it’s placing a new emphasis not just on creating such tools, but on ensuring that they’re easy to find and to use.\\n\\nA new product called Favorites, which improves on the previous See First control, allows you to see the top friends and Pages that Facebook predicts are the most meaningful to you — and, importantly, you can adopt those suggestions or simply add other friends and Pages if you want. Posts from people or Pages that you manually select will then be boosted in your News Feed and marked with a star. Such posts will also populate a new Favorites feed, an alternative to the standard News Feed.\\n\\nFor some time, it has been possible to view your News Feed chronologically, so that the most recent posts appear highest up. This turns off algorithmic ranking, something that should be of comfort to those who mistrust Facebook’s algorithms playing a role in what they see. But this feature hasn’t always been easy to find. So Facebook is introducing a new “Feed Filter Bar” to make toggling between this Most Recent feed, the standard News Feed, and the new Favorites feed easier.\\n\\nSimilarly, for some time Facebook has tried to increase transparency around why a particular ad has appeared in your News Feed through the “Why Am I Seeing This?” tool, which you can see by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of an ad. This was extended to most posts in your News Feed in 2019, and today it’s available for some suggested posts too, so you can better understand why those cookery videos or movie news articles keep appearing as you scroll.\\n\\nThese measures are part of a significant shift in the company’s thinking about how it gives people greater understanding of, and control over, how its algorithms rank content, and how it can at the same time utilize content ranking and distribution to ensure the platform has a positive impact on society as a whole.\\n\\nOther measures coming this year include providing more transparency about how the distribution of problematic content is reduced; making it easier to understand what content is popular in News Feed; launching more surveys to better understand how people feel about the interactions they have on Facebook and transparently adjusting our ranking algorithms based on the results; publishing more of the signals and predictions that guide the News Feed ranking process; and connecting people with authoritative information in more areas where there is a clear societal benefit, like the climate science and racial justice hubs. More changes are planned over the course of the year.\\n\\nMaking Peace with the Machines\\n\\nPutting more choices into the people’s hands is not a panacea for all the problems that can occur on an open social platform like Facebook. Many can and do choose sensational and polarizing content over alternatives.\\n\\nSocial media lets people discuss, share, and criticize freely and at scale, without the boundaries or mediation previously imposed by the gatekeepers of the traditional media industry. For hundreds of millions of people, it is the first time that they have been able to speak freely and be heard in this way, with no barrier to entry apart from an internet connection. People don’t just have a video camera in their pocket — with social media, they also have the means to distribute what they see.\\n\\nThis is a dramatic and historic democratization of speech. And like any democratizing force, it challenges existing power structures. Political and cultural elites are confronting a raucous online conversation that they can’t control, and many are understandably anxious about it.\\n\\nWherever possible, I believe that people should be able to choose for themselves, and that people can generally be trusted to know what is best for them. But I am also acutely conscious that we need collectively-agreed ground rules, both on social media platforms and in society at large, to reduce the likelihood that the choices exercised freely by individuals will lead to collective harms. Politics is in large part a conversation about how we define those ground rules in a way that enjoys the widest possible legitimacy, and the challenge that social media now faces is, for better or worse, inherently political.\\n\\nShould a private company be intervening to shape the ideas that flow across its systems, above and beyond the prevention of serious harms like incitement to violence and harassment? If so, who should make that decision? Should it be determined by an independent group of experts? Should governments set out what kinds of conversation citizens are allowed to participate in? Is there a way in which a deeply polarized society like the U.S. could ever agree on what a healthy national conversation looks like? How do we account for the fact that the internet is borderless and speech rules will need to accommodate a multiplicity of cultural perspectives?\\n\\nThese are profound questions — and ones that shouldn’t be left to technology companies to answer on their own.\\n\\nPromoting individual agency is the easy bit. Identifying content which is harmful and keeping it off the internet is challenging, but doable. But agreeing on what constitutes the collective good is very hard indeed. A case in point is the decision Facebook took to suspend former President Trump from the platform. Many welcomed the decision — indeed, many argued strongly that it was about time that Facebook and others took such decisive action. It is a decision that I absolutely believe was right. But it was also perhaps the most dramatic example of the power of technology in public discourse, and it has provoked legitimate questions about the balance of responsibility between private companies and public and political authorities.\\n\\nWhether governments now choose to tighten the terms of online debate or private companies choose to do so themselves, we should remain wary of the conclusion that the answer to these dilemmas is always less speech. While we shouldn’t assume that perfect freedom leads to perfect outcomes, nor should we assume that extending freedom of speech will lead to a degradation of society. Implicit in the arguments made by many of social media’s critics is an assumption that people can’t be trusted with an extensive right to free speech; or that this freedom is an illusion and that their minds are really being controlled by the algorithm and the sinister intentions of its Big Tech masters.\\n\\nPerhaps it is time to acknowledge it is not simply the fault of faceless machines? Consider, for example, the presence of bad and polarizing content on private messaging apps — iMessage, Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp — used by billions of people around the world. None of those apps deploy content or ranking algorithms. It’s just humans talking to humans without any machine getting in the way. In many respects, it would be easier to blame everything on algorithms, but there are deeper and more complex societal forces at play. We need to look at ourselves in the mirror, and not wrap ourselves in the false comfort that we have simply been manipulated by machines all along.\\n\\nThe truth is machines have not taken over, but they are here to stay. We need to make our peace with them.\\n\\nA better understanding of the relationship between the user and the algorithm is in everyone’s interest. People need to have confidence in the systems that are so integral to modern life. The internet needs new rules for the road that can command broad public consent. And tech companies need to know the parameters within which society is comfortable for them to operate, so that they have permission to continue to innovate. That starts with openness and transparency, and with giving you more control.',\n",

While others having been chasing press and profit, we’ve been looking for patterns. We now understand perhaps better than anyone the myriad of connections between emotions, belief systems and health. When we made the decision in 2016 to allow spiritual and religious content on our platform people said it was a bad idea. But it turned out to the best decision we ever made; because how can you possibly hope to help people transform if you can’t meet them at their level of understanding? Today we oversee a long arc of belief systems from scientific & evidence-based practices to religious & faith based teachings plus every colour in between. It’s a beautiful thing. More importantly, it helps us understand health and happiness like no one else can.\\n\\nI’ll talk more about these things in our 2021 Year in Review (out at Christmas) and I’ll share some insights about the tools we’re developing. For now here are four pillars which form the basis of our product decisions.\\n\\n1. Spiritual wellbeing, not mental health\\n\\nAustralian National University defines Spiritual Health as ”not referring to any particular religious or spiritual practice or ideology but to the human need for meaning, purpose and connection to something greater than ourselves. It is a very diverse and often individualised aspect to health, giving context and meaning to all other parts of ourselves and our life experiences.”\\n\\nIn other words, sanitised mindfulness apps and packaged mental health EAPS which fail to acknowledge a universal truth — that we are spiritual beings with different belief systems — won’t work. (It’s taken longer than I thought it would, but I believe people will soon start to notice that some of these emperors aren’t wearing any clothes). To create happier and healthier people takes a holistic and preventative approach, combining tools for everyday wellbeing, space for long-term transformational experiences, and the ability to meet people at their level of understanding with highly personalised content and community support.\\n\\n2. It’s a lifelong journey and unique to you\\n\\nJoseph Campbell wrote that health and happiness is achieved through deep transformational journeys over the course of a lifetime. Most companies today offer only very basic relief for immediate symptoms and simply aren’t equiped to help you over the long term. We believe both situations are essential for Spiritual Wellbeing and you will hear us talk a lot more about Everyday Wellbeing and Transformational Shifts. In fact we have organised our entire team around these two things and we’re betting our future on them.\\n\\nHowever these two things on their own aren’t enough. No two individuals are the same; an African American Christian has a different belief system to an atheist living in Paris. One hundred million anonymised search terms on Insight Timer confirm this.\\n\\nOur growing library of 115,000 free teachings, combined with a new supportive social layer and machine learning engine, means we are now able to offer everyone a highly personalised experience for their Everyday Wellbeing and Transformational Shifts.\\n\\n3. Community is essential\\n\\nD’Arcy Coolica from Andreessen Horowitz thinks the best version of any product is intrinsically social and that a product’s growth and engagement improves the more social it becomes. Why is this? Why do products which are built around community always become more successful in the long run if they’re so so SO much harder to build? Three years of Anthropology at Sydney Uni makes this an easy one… people are simply better off together. We learn faster. Live longer. Accomplish more. And feel safer. Yes we need moments of quiet solitude — lots of them in fact — but the journey to health and happiness is impossible without others.\\n\\n4. Social doesn’t have to be toxic.\\n\\nThere are three problems with social platforms today.\\n\\nFirstly, their founders have become so rich no one is willing to stand up to them. If only more people would listen to Scott Galloway. I love him.\\n\\nSecondly, social platforms run on ads and ads rely on your attention and attention is increased with negative content and on and on it goes. Even though we all understand this now, and our daughters are dying of suicide more frequently, well… see Point 1. (I wish Steve Jobs was alive today. Yes yes, I’ve read all the stories and you can say what you like, but he’s the only person I can think of who would have held Facebook accountable. Steve magically miniaturised everything down into our pocket before Zuckerberg magnified everything back out again by turning iPhones into megaphones. Screen time isn’t the problem. Facebook is.)\\n\\nFinally, social platforms are expression engines. Why is this a problem? Anthropology also taught me that the mere act of observing something changes the very nature of the thing being observed. Ergo, no one is really who they say they are on social media, no matter how much they think they are. And how on earth is someone meant to complete a deep transformational shift (let alone help someone else) if they’re not who they think they are?\\n\\nInsight Timer loses $8m a year and we detest ads. So that takes care of one and two. And we now think we know how to fix the third one with a new type of ‘supportive social’ layer that doesn’t become toxic with time. More on this later.',\n",

We actually wanted to know their thoughts about the podcast, how and if they interact with our website and our social media accounts and to get feedback for the whole initiative.\\n\\n“Very interesting idea, you always make content, keep up with the hard work”\\n\\n“The whole initiative about youth employment is approached very professionally and advanced”\\n\\n“The english level is very high during every podcast”\\n\\n“Congratulations for the good job”\\n\\nPhrases like those were the first feedback that we had, regarding the host and the content of the podcast, our social media accounts and the website. Some of the listeners, as far as the podcast is concerned, had recommended a more interlocutory approach without the stress of the first time.\\n\\nAbout the statistical data of the “Employment kit”, the numbers speak for themselves. The trailer and the 1st episode have 66 plays and 23 unique listeners. We have also achieved the attraction of our target audience, as the vast majority of our listeners are 18 to 27 years old, and a geographical diversity as our users are from Greece (89%), Ukraine (6%), Spain (3%), Luxembourg (1%) and other countries (1%). We hope to bridge the geographical gap and bring closer the whole world with our voice in the future.\\n\\nOur social media accounts were the most important pillars of the communication of our idea. Both on Instagram and Facebook, our pages achieved to increase awareness about youth employment and more specifically about “Employment Kit”, to drive traffic to our website and to build a community. In the last month the total number of people that reached our facebook page was approximately 1.500, and the engagement of our facebook posts is equivalent to 509. Concerning our Instagram account @employment_kit, with differentiated content, the page, with 50 followers managed to attract organisations and pages of other podcasts, and a number of comments under some of the instagram posts. Finally, the views of the IGTV Video, about our 1st episode “An IT Specialist’s perspective”, were 245.\\n\\nEmployment Kit for us, was and is a passion project in order to act and support youth employment.

              "   'Most children and young people today use at least one type of technology every day. From accessing the internet to doing homework, watching online content, and gaming, technology has grown exponentially in recent years. But what’s the role of digital media influencing young minds rapidly?\\n\\nThe Power of Social Media :\\n\\nWith time as technology is getting advanced day by day, Social Media is getting more powerful when it comes to communication. Well, not to forget that it has got some benefits also.\\n\\nWe get to gather and access unlimited numbers of information and daily updates. Nowadays the entire world has come within our hands we can connect to the entire world at any time, anywhere in just a click.\\n\\nNot only this, but social media also helps people to motivate and work for social changes as well. It allows the young people to say and place their point of view.\\n\\nIt vastly helped them as their voices are reaching the person globally. The online world has lots of potentials to help young people to explore new concepts.\\n\\nChildren in the Digital Age\\n\\nA smartphone remains the most common device among children. In India, 21% of urban Indian children and tweens (pre-teens) mirror mobile Internet use as seen among their older counterparts.\\n\\nKids and teens are more likely than teenagers to watch a video on YouTube once a week. They spend about seven hours a day using cell phone gadgets, watching TV, and using game consoles.\\n\\nChildwise’s estimates in the UK indicate that smartphone ownership rises with age, from one in five 5–6-year-olds to two in five 7–8-year-olds and more than half of those aged 9–10.\\n\\nNine in ten children own a smartphone by the time children enter high school, rising to almost all 13–16 year-olds. In the US, by the age of 11, more than half of children own a smartphone.\\n\\nAmerican teens use screens for seven hours, 22 minutes a day, and 8–12 year-olds were found to spend an average of 4 hours 44 minutes using screens per day.\\n\\nLosing on the Roundabouts, Gaining on the Swings\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the use of digital technology by children has positive as well as negative angles. Learning can be affected by digital media that distract from social interactions.\\n\\nWhile other media may increase social interactions and education. If I want to talk about it in simple words then the media can also promote teamwork and team building in original form.\\n\\nNow talking about the good aspects of the digital platform we should not forget that there are many bad aspects of digital platforms as well.\\n\\nLet’s get started with the positive and negative aspects of the digital platform.\\n\\nPositive Aspects:\\n\\nPreparing for future tech careers:\\n\\nThere will be more demand for professionals ready to take on technology careers as technology continues to grow and flourish. They are more prepared for their future and the opportunities it offers when children begin to get excited about technology and the potential it offers them from a young age.\\n\\nChildren can start early to acquire the technological skills they will need in the future. Consider an IT degree if you want to build your career and want to get started on the path.\\n\\nIf you are a young student who has the technical background you need for an IT career, it’ll just make it easier for you.\\n\\nImproved multitasking:\\n\\nStudies show that using technology helps young kids learn more effectively how to multitask. Although multitasking never allows you to concentrate fully on one area, learners can learn how to listen and type notes or do other multitasking activities.\\n\\nImproved visual-spatial development :\\n\\nSpatial development :\\n\\nWhen technology such as video games is used to help train young students and children, it can be greatly enhanced. It can be a great way to improve skills by practicing visual-spatial abilities with video games.\\n\\nIn a variety of things, such as map reading, puzzles, and more, visual-spatial skills are required.\\n\\nOur children do not live in a division of contrasting online lives in the real world, both of which are indispensable for their development. The digital world can provide family and friends with links, build social networks, support identity creation, and introduce young minds to different perspectives.\\n\\nNegative aspects :\\n\\nCyberbullying :\\n\\nConcerns about the negative effects of the use of digital media, such as cyberbullying and self-harm, frequently mimic in-person bullying in terms of its negative emotional and social impact. But can be more serious because of anonymity and the influence of the network.\\n\\nThe implications of digital media and their continuing digital presence should be learned by children and adolescents.\\n\\nWhen creativity flourishes, so do the bullying. Without having to face them, children and teenagers use technology and social media to threaten other children.\\n\\nThis movement, also called cyberbullying, is rising and becoming more popular with even younger students.\\n\\nSocial interaction issues :\\n\\nWith more time spent on technology, younger kids have trouble with social interactions face-to-face. In comparison to talking to each other in person, many seem to prefer texting or talking on social media.\\n\\nThey may spend more time texting or on their phones even though kids spend time together than they are actually together. This is one of the negative points in the role of digital media influencing young minds rapidly\\n\\nRisk of depression :\\n\\nDepression is a central concern associated with the increased use of the media. This has raised suicide rates and has contributed to more young people seeking medication and therapy for mental health interventions.\\n\\nExperts think that time spent on social media or using apps can be directly related to increased depression.\\n\\nIn the digital world, behavioral results are not so different from those of older generations. Even if the platform varies, the acts are simply the same.\\n\\nAlthough there is both online uncertainty and potential, the risk is not always undesirable, and it can be worthwhile to fail safely. Parents should also strive to consider and proactively discuss social media protocol and privacy protections with children.\\n\\nDoes Social Media create an impact on mental health?\\n\\nTalking about mental health the psychologist has started to look after the effects that are caused by social media. After completing the total research the doctors have come with the result that immense amounts of mental health are being affected by social media.\\n\\nAs the majority of the people whether it’s children or teenagers are using the social media platform in an improper way or better to say negatively. Due to this reason, it is creating a huge impact on mental health.\\n\\nLet’s take an overview of the research of what doctors have come up with. There are 2 main points upon which social media is creating a negative impact and they are: –\\n\\nGoing after the post likes to drive self — esteem :\\n\\nStaying active on Social media platforms and posting regular pictures and updating status is worrisome. It can be linked to anxiety, diminishing mental health, and also poor body image.\\n\\nConstantly looking for approval and running after the external validation. And all these things do not develop a secured sense of self which is not dependent on arbitrary condition.\\n\\nClicking pictures editing them and posting them on social media platforms for others to evaluate, and if they don’t get that amount of like shares and comments on social media then they start all over again hence it creates self-awareness and impression management which is actually inherent in social media engagements, and this creates an impact on mental health.\\n\\nImpact on Sleep :\\n\\nHeavy usage of Mobile phones, tablets, and laptops can create a negative impact on mental health. This point is very much relevant when it comes to sleep and sleep disturbances.\\n\\nSeveral studies and many doctors have proven this thing also. Sleep is a crucial thing for developing adolescent brain and less sleep is associated with lower mood and depression.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThere is a separate call to devote further research funding to concerns related to the exposure of children and the use of digital media, an area that is still on the rise. It is perhaps unsurprising, considering the multi-faceted world of technology, that the role of digital media in influencing young minds rapidly is extraordinarily complex.\\n\\nMany unanswered puzzles remain about the role of technology in the creation of children. What we do know is that, in science, we have a collection of instruments that can influence the actions of children.\\n\\nWhat remains, which is not trivial, is to discover how to direct this potential to intentionally achieve desired results.\\n\\nOriginal Article : Role Of Digital Media Influencing Young Minds Rapidly\\n\\nView top rated courses from industry-led experts.\\n\\nVisit : Webdrills',\n",

              "   'Over the past decade, we’ve done a lot of research into online diaspora communities around the world, covering a variety of cultures and nationalities. Over 10 so far and what we suspect may be, the largest analysis of diaspora communities in the world. As we recently sifted through the data, we found some common elements to all digital diaspora communities.\\n\\nPhoto by Sergio Capuzzimati on Unsplash\\n\\nSo how do we do this research? We use a methodology called Netnography, which is taken from the real-world anthropological method called ethnography. Basically, it is the systematic study of a culture. Netnography is a similar process but done entirely online. The term and initial frameworks and yes, even the book, was developed by Robert Kozinets at the Annenburg School for Journalism and Communications in California. At sapient.d We apply netnography for digital diaspora research, but also for brand and online reputation analysis, competitor insights and market research. It adds quite an insightful layer to traditional forms of expensive and time-consuming research such as surveys and focus groups.\\n\\nCommonalities of Digital Diaspora Groups\\n\\nAs we looked at the volumes of data around conversations, lexicology, semiotics, group behaviours and social indicators, we found that many communities share key elements. These serve two primary functions for diaspora communities; 1) to provide key indicators to members of a community for self-identification and group solidarity and 2) to provide a common set of symbols and cultural meanings by which their community can be easily identified by non-communities in their non-origin country of residence and in attracting other diaspora.\\n\\nGenerational Participation: Interestingly, we found that second and third generation diaspora will be more digitally engaged than the first generation. This may be that the first immigrating generation left their country of origin for reasons of distress such as political, conflict or religious. Later generations will be loyal to the country they are born in, but seek a connection to their country of origin.\\n\\nSymbology (Semiotics): Diaspora communities will seek to use the primary symbols of their origin country across social media and wherever they engage online. Either as an image and often as part of the “handle” or avatar name they use in online forums. For example, Welsh diaspora use the red dragon of Wales, while Scottish will use the Rampant Lion while Indian and Ethiopian diaspora will often use a lion and South Africans will use the springbok. They may also use objects such as the Harp for Irish and a variation of the Spartan helmet for Greeks.\\n\\nNational Sports Symbolism: We found this in every diaspora community, with the most common sport being soccer, followed by cricket and rugby, then baseball. Diaspora communities will share national team rankings, news of top players and symbols of those teams. Often, sports will play a role in fostering positive dialogues between diaspora communities online.\\n\\nMusic: This is another commonality to diaspora communities. Music sharing platforms such as Spotify, SoundCloud or Apple Music will often have cultural playlists created by diaspora communities and used to connect with citizens in their host or naturalized country. Often times, a diaspora person will create a music video that mixes together their cultural origin music with that most common in their naturalized country.\\n\\nNational Dress: Most countries around the world have some form of national dress such as the sari in India, the vyshyvanka embroidered shirt of Ukraine and the intricately designed shirts and dresses of North American indigenous tribes. Sometimes clothing items are obtained or created by diaspora communities and shared through online image sharing apps such as Instagram, Snap or TikTok.\\n\\nAll of these elements are key parts of what form a cultural group, including language and writing. Understanding digital diaspora communities can help us understand how diaspora engage in their new countries and help countries of origin connect with diaspora communities for economic development such as inward investment and tourism. Such insights can also help in times of international crises when connecting families and seeking aid.',\n",

              "   \"Whether consumers call it happy hour, an “apéro”, or an after-work drink, the end of the workday is a popular moment of consumption around the world. For alcohol brands, happy hours are an opportunity to promote new alcohol. Bartenders and bars are a key component of the consumer experience and have great insight into what their patrons are enjoying. With the usual opportunities to meet friends and family gone as the pandemic continues, people are craving the celebratory moments of pre-pandemic life.\\n\\nMany are increasingly working from home, making it harder to distinguish an end to the workday and the start of leisure time. Brands and consumers are working to reclaim the time, and re-establish happy hour as a key weekly consumption moment. Those who might typically enjoy a happy hour during the week took to social media to show off their home bartending creations. As a result, discussions of at-home cocktails increased by 836% in 2020. Ultimately, happy hours did not stop, they simply changed to accommodate the new normal. As consumers redefine occasions for consumption, which moments are resonating the most, and how can brands reach them?\\n\\nConsumers are Adapting to a Change of Pace\\n\\nThe change in the meaning and importance of ‘happy hour’ is clear when we take a look at hundreds of thousands of user-generated social media posts from January 2020 through January 2021. As 2020 began, coworkers and friends could end the day with a quick and early drink at a pub, bar, or restaurant. Posts on social media discussed drink specials, indicated excitement, and were rooted in meeting face-to-face.\\n\\nAffects associated with ‘happy hour and #happyhour’ Jan 1, 2020 — Jan 31, 2020, size indicates volume | Source: Radarly\\n\\nBy May, the conversation around ‘happy hour’ had shifted. Many cities across the world were restricting access to bars and restaurants. This severed the link between alcohol brands and their local patrons. Virtual happy hours gained a larger share of the conversation. Social Media users posted about missing happy hour and how difficult it was to be under lockdown.\\n\\nAffects associated with ‘happy hour and #happyhour’ May 1, 2020 — May 31, 2020, size indicates volume | Source: Radarly\\n\\nConsumers are trying to fill their bartender void and had started getting creative with homemade cocktails. The ready-to-drink craze hit a second wave, as hard seltzers and other canned drinks make a perfect low-commitment ingredient for experimenting with new flavors.\\n\\nAdjusting to Consumer Demands\\n\\nSavvy alcohol brands quickly realized that with bars and restaurants closed, increased social listening and brand empathy could serve both consumer and product needs. Distillers kicked into gear in the background, manufacturing in-demand products like hand sanitizer. They listened to consumer conversations online to make sure their social posts were empathetic to the need to not drink with friends, for a while.\\n\\nBon Viv partnered with LA Mag Food and Gabriel Briseno to teach viewers how to make their own cocktails using Bon Viv on Instagram. As 2020 endured and employees who were able worked from living rooms, kitchen tables, and more, the separation between work and home blurred. Consumers created new routines for the end of their workdays. Virtual happy hours declined in popularity after the first few months of working from home.\\n\\nVolume of posts from individuals (not brands) mentioning happy hour and Zoom, Facetime, virtual, or video across Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook |Source: Radarly\\n\\nMaking Bourbon Time the Happiest Hour\\n\\nBoth bars and alcohol brands have had to get creative with their approaches for maintaining relationships with consumers. As social distancing measures are set to persist through mid-2021, restaurants have switched to carry-out cocktails and alcohol brand marketing budgets have shifted from in-person events to creating unique experiences for customers right at home.\\n\\nAmerican Beverage subsidiary, Beam Suntory noticed that 6 pm — 7 pm no longer resonated with alcohol drinkers as the “happiest hour” launched a campaign to re-establish a stronger work-life balance. Beam brands are promoting #6ourbon7ime to encourage people to unwind for an hour with a glass of bourbon and are leveraging the popular hashtag #TheHappiestHour , as well. With the absence of in-person events like concerts, Beam brands are partnering with popular entertainers like singers Charli XCX and Brad Paisley and actors like Keegan Michael Key to spread awareness of “#6ourbon7ime”.\\n\\nTo maximize the success of their campaign and increase engagement directly with consumers, Jim Beam has started sending reminders of happy hour to Twitter followers who opt-in. There is a hearty appetite for happy hour discussion most weeks (the exception being the Christmas and New Years' holidays) as Beam Suntory can continue their efforts to match the consumer conversation trends.\\n\\nPost volume associated with ‘happy hour and #happyhour’ Nov 2020 — Feb 2020, not including retweets | Source: Radarly\\n\\nWhen individuals are posting about happy hour recipes that use bourbon or whiskey/whisky they reflect a desire for easy and refreshing cocktails. By showing drinkers how to unwind with a special treat, Beam Suntory has a great opportunity to share cocktail ideas with folks who want to try their hand at making their own drinks.\\n\\nAffects associated with happy hour recipes including bourbon, whiskey, and whiskey from individual authors from September 2020 to February 2021 | Source: Radarly\\n\\nAs patrons return to bars and restaurants as pandemic restrictions ease, we’re left with the question “what are consumer expectations for returning to public drinking?” With the investment in home bars, will consumers have stronger preferences now that we’ve dialed in our favorite home cocktails? Will the benefits of drinking with friends outweigh these preferences? Alcohol brands can keep an eye on the preferences of drinkers to make sure that they are appearing at the right time and place as drinkers return to public.\\n\\nStay on Top of the Trends\\n\\nFrom health and safety concerns to expressions of nostalgia about bar ambiance and good times with friends, there’s a lot to prepare for and learn from consumers. A significant part of the equation are bartenders — understanding how patrons feel about their bartenders and hearing how bartenders express their experiences will be crucial in re-creating the bar ambiance that is greatly missed during the pandemic.\\n\\nThrough 2021, AI-enabled consumer insights will prove invaluable for beverage brands as social trends shift. Understanding emerging moments of consumption and trends associated with alcohol-centric holidays will hinge on having real-time and on-demand access to conversations from patrons and bartenders. Digital moments will continue to play an essential role in keeping consumer attention while in-person events make a slow return. Ultimately, a push toward a more consumer-centric strategy help will build on the digital and direct-to-consumer foundation that has been solidly established in the last year.\",\n",

              "   'The concept of traditional tactics of marketing and advertising is dismantling bit by bit, and therefore, experts devised a new tool: Content marketing. People nearly despise those interrupting commercials run while they are watching their favorite shows. With online media booming, people’s attention shifted to personal screens. However, the business of ads continues its pestering on virtual world as well. As a result, content marketing has been taking shape for the last few years.\\n\\nWhat is Content Marketing?\\n\\nIt is all about creating and distributing/publishing content. Make no mistake, the content is not just restricted to text or words; it can be videos, graphics, animations, music, podcasts, or anything. The idea of content marketing is to wrap the brand message in the content. Hence, a brand, product, or service is subtly sandwiched between the palatable layers. And the ingredients of layers are eye-catching designs, attention-grabbing stories, and engaging conversations.\\n\\nWhy Content Marketing?\\n\\nJames O’Brien of Contently wrote on Mashable, “The idea central to content marketing is that a brand must give something valuable to get something valuable in return. Instead of the commercial, be the show. Instead of the banner ad, be the feature story.”\\n\\nThis new form of marketing is mainly used by marketers to build trust and rapport with the target audience. It involves an entire brand building exercise and normally, a team of professionals actively generates and distributes contents on digital platforms.\\n\\nSince it is a long-term exercise, content marketing requires an effective marketing strategy. This is where following the best of content marketing becomes essential for any brand manager.\\n\\nSocial Media for Interaction\\n\\nSocial media are useful platforms to interact with target audience. However, selection of medium largely depends on your consumer psycography. Hence, define the consumer and then choose the medium. There are multiple social media channels available; Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, and more. But only you can decide where your target audience dwells. If your consumers are on Facebook, approach them on that medium with relevant content.\\n\\nOne of the best examples of social media use is how weapon making companies hire models to promote guns on Instagram. As the medium does not allow promotion of weapons, companies asked models like Kimberly Matte to flaunt guns and upload their photos on Instagram. The message quickly gets spread as celebrities enjoy huge fan-following, running in millions.\\n\\nInformative Content Sharing Through Infographics\\n\\nInfographics is a better way to share information. A graphical presentation of data of statistics is easy for readers to understand. A brand can create infographics to explain merits and demerits or pros and cons of its products/services, and compare them with competitions.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of infographic is it can be shared instantly on multiple medium, and people can download the image on their smartphones, tablets, or computers.\\n\\nBrands have effectively used infographics for knowledge sharing, and they promote their products/services in the disguise of knowledge. Visuals help brands create a lasting impression in the minds of consumers.\\n\\nApart from brands, artists have explored full potential of infographics. See how (below) a New York-based designer Shangning Wang shows how he is influenced by great minds of the world.\\n\\nSerious Conversations on Blogs — Text and Videos\\n\\nBlogging is one of the easiest and most effective tools of content marketing. It is cost-effective and does not require any special skill of technology. There are many free blogging platforms like WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Medium, and others. A noteworthy feature of all the platforms is it can be accessed by any person in your organization. CEOs and managing directors of multinational corporations use blog to connect with audience.\\n\\nBlogs allow users to express their personal thoughts as well. It is your place, so you can use (or abuse) this virtual diary. Many brands use blogs for employer branding by sharing their achievements, work culture, employee benefit programs, and related content.\\n\\nDigital marketing expert Neil Patel has extensively used blogging to disseminate knowledge and information about digital marketing, social media, search engine optimization and other stuff.\\n\\nDebates on Podcasts\\n\\nIf you are in the business of selling ideas, podcast is the best medium to connect with your target audience. Even though it is a non-visual medium, podcasts offer great opportunities for brands to send your ideas to millions of listeners.\\n\\nBrands can organize debates and discussions around the products or services they provide. They can invite guests and experts to speak about innovations and inventions. For consumers, they can either download podcasts or stream the content on their devices.\\n\\nLike blogs, podcasts are popular for personal branding. With a little investment, any content creator can start podcasts. All they need to do is record their shows/programs and upload the audio files on different channels, which work as publishers. Consumers can then subscribe to your podcasts.\\n\\nAs a brand manager, you can directly ask hosts of podcasts to talk about the products, services, or brands. This is a smart way to convey your marketing message to your audience.\\n\\nRespond to Consumers’ Queries on Forums\\n\\nConsumers have a lot of questions about the products and services. And they want answers from the horse’s mouth. Running a forum on brand’s website is the best way to connect with consumers.\\n\\nA moderator can oversee the discussions and debates on the forum, and s/he would ensure that participants do not go astray and they should not launch themselves into a verbal abuse.\\n\\nMicrosoft has set a perfect example in its Xbox forum, where gamers can form communities for new game launches, issues, Xbox updates, and more.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nContent marketing provides unlimited opportunities for brand managers to expand and publish their messages. Once they amass even a small number of interested audience, it becomes easy to grow. The advertising landscape that was 50 years ago is not what we witnessed in the 1990s. As time changes, MARCOM professionals have to understand the different thought processes of the audience. To stay relevant in this evolving world, prepare and be ready to embrace the new advancements.',\n",

              "   'According to Vishal Shah, Instagram’s VP of Product, Instagram is still in the process of testing and evaluating the removal of like counts from its platform. Currently, tests are being conducted in various regions such as the UK, Brazil and Australia to determine how the removal of the like count feature affects users’ posting and engagement habits.\\n\\nOfficials at Instagram believe that removing the like count will relieve a pressure to perform that many influencers and everyday users face on the app. In turn, they anticipate that users will be more likely to post more often as a result of not feeling so pressured to outperform themselves or others. If this is the case, this would be a win not only for users’ self-confidence and creative freedom, but it would also be a win for Instagram. If users feel more confident to post more often, Instagram will reap the benefits of increased user activity.\\n\\nAdditionally, Instagram recognizes that posts are becoming less effective at driving engagement as Stories become increasingly popular. Andrew Hutchinson writes in an article from Social Media Today, “when you consider the rise of the Stories format, public engagement metrics are no longer the things that drive behavior.” For business owners and social media managers, this means that a greater emphasis will need to be placed on their brand’s Stories to track engagement. They will still need to produce high-quality content for their Instagram grids to maintain their brand image, but the metrics behind their Stories will be the true indicator of engagement and success.\\n\\nPersonally, it will take me a while to get used to not having a like count on Instagram if the app decides to move forward with the change. I admit that whenever I make a new post, I try to outperform the post before it. It has become a game I play in my own head, but I can see where it is toxic and creates a pressure for me to perform. Overall, I believe removing the like counter will be a win-win for Instagram and its users; it will just take a while to adapt.',\n",

              "   'Brand reputation is not merely a trend word. It can have a significant impact on results and sales and, albeit not always in a positive way. And social media is a slippery floor for brands if they don’t know how to maintain their presence and reputation online. Below are some tips on managing brand reputation on social media.\\n\\nBe Consistent\\n\\nSocial media, when used properly, delivers great results. Build a strategy of what to post and where. Highlight your product value and the story behind it. Think about your tone of communication and kind of message will cater to your audience. Always keep an eye on your performance, to ensure that the brand is moving in the right direction on social media.\\n\\nRegular posting will help the brand gain credibility and generate brand awareness. As your brand is getting recognition, you need to focus on brand reputation to maintain what you already gained.\\n\\nBe Responsive\\n\\nSocial media is not a broadcasting channel — it is about conversing with people. You need to build a dialogue by being responsive to them. To do this successfully as a brand, you need to check these out:\\n\\nDo you have a clear schedule of duties for your team? What happens to messages, comments and reviews left over the weekend?\\n\\nDo you have a crisis management plan in place? Do you know what to do, and what to answer when a crisis situation arises?\\n\\nDo you have set up KPIs for response time? Customers have highly sensitive expectations for responses on social media.\\n\\nSocial Listening\\n\\nMonitor brand mentions. While social media platforms are essential, you shouldn’t forget the rest of the internet. Monitoring mentions can prevent a crisis, or identify brand ambassadors you didn’t know you had. It will also indicate the sentiment, the context, and the places where your brand is mentioned the most.\\n\\nPersonal Branding\\n\\nDoes personal branding really matter for your brand reputation? Generally, the leadership and executive team need to have their online presence aligned with the brand’s vision and mission.\\n\\nAll employees should be mindful of what they post online, and how it may relate to the company they work for.\\n\\nThere have been quite a few cases where an employee impacted a company’s brand reputation. It doesn’t matter if you are in the C-suite or just a junior assistant. Try to provide value on social media when it comes to the brand you are connected to.\\n\\nSocial Proof\\n\\nBe responsive and answer all reviews and feedback, no matter if they appear on Facebook, TripAdvisor or Yelp. Remember that people are more likely to leave negative reviews than leave a recount of their positive experience. Address every doubt and request by responding on time and providing valuable answers and solutions. Don’t take them personally — with proper management you can turn complaints into an amazing customer experience.',\n",

Its signature blue boxes are one of the only jewelry brands to have such a strong foothold in pop culture. From the many brand references, to icons like Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s and references to the brand in other films, Tiffany & Co. has sedimented its spot as one the most recognizable brands in the U.S.\\n\\nCurrently Tiffany & Co. has around 7.1 million followers on Instagram, 9.4 million on Facebook, 1.58 million on Twitter, and 171,000 over on Pinterest. Their social influence cannot be denied, however let’s take a look at how they interact with consumers online. They have a very detail-oriented response system, fielding customer inquiries like the one below with very specific and action-oriented replies.\\n\\nThey take the presentation of their products very seriously, and in the other instances like the one below even respond to questions regarding their shipping and bag quality, even if to the larger audience it seems minuscule.\\n\\nThis is a great example of how Tiffany & Co. operates and sustains its luxury status in spite of being such a well-known brand to all households. There are many other comparable brands that would rather operate under the premise of exclusivity. However, Tiffany & Co. has proven that with excellent consumer listening, carefully curated social content and celebrity endorsements, it can maintain its widespread recognition.\\n\\n“Although it’s been around since 1873, Tiffany & Co. has created a content marketing strategy that feels fresh and innovative. The brand has figured out a way to embrace social media while remaining just elite enough to come out on the other side with their well-earned reputation intact.”\\n\\nTheir high-quality, simplistic and consistent marketing lends to its success online.

              "   'Photo credit: Rory Tucker\\n\\nHOW IT FELT TO BE BLOCKED: PART 1\\n\\nI was about to leave for the airport. As I packed my carryon, my mind fell to the sketchbook. I always brought the tiny, green leather book with me on flights. A gift given to me a couple of years back, the sketchbook made me realize I hadn’t heard from the giver in a long time.\\n\\nThe giver of the sketchbook was someone who could have been a good friend had it not been for the fact that we rarely saw each other. I admired them. They had mad art and gardening skills. We had things in common. We enjoyed intelligent conversation. They seemed down-to-earth and genuine. They were generous. They had excellent taste (in sketchbooks). I liked them so much I introduced them to a friend assuming they would hit it off; they did.\\n\\nIn the moment of packing, I realized I had done a lousy job of staying in touch. I wrote an email to them before heading out the door. Contacting them felt risky. I had the impression they didn’t want to know me any longer. I played dumb. I knew they had blocked me on Instagram, our usual way to stay in touch. I mentioned that I missed seeing their updates in my feed. I invited them to go to tea. I took a deep breath and hit send.\\n\\nThey got back to me the same day. I didn’t expect them to respond. Their response was honest to the nth degree:\\n\\n“Yes, I did block your accounts on Insta — sending you some tough love. For me, it’s not about how many followers one has. I’m getting annoyed by the perfect shots (often taken by someone else) in the name of a sell and the paragraphs and paragraphs of inspirational quotes and deep wisdom offset by crass language. I’m not talking just about your accounts but the platform in general. I guess I’m getting old. I’m even getting tired of my own content — it just all seems so self-indulgent. Take care.”\\n\\nMY SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN CONFIRMED: THEY HAD BLOCKED ME.\\n\\nTheir response stung. The thing that hurt the most was the fact that instead of talking to me about it directly, they opted to passively exit stage left. If I hadn’t sent an email that day we would have gone about our lives never to talk again aside from the off chance we ran into each other in a cafe or something.\\n\\nI cried. I felt shamed. I felt betrayed. I felt misunderstood. I realized they didn’t know me at all. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised by this seeing as it was now glaringly obvious I didn’t know them either. We can think we know who someone is but then something happens to remind you that you’re only slightly more acquainted than strangers. The realization left me feeling gutted.\\n\\nIf they had asked me, they may have found out the real story behind why and what I post. The quotes, the paragraphs of writing, the photographs were all things that I loved. Every single word I’d even written was genuine. Had it all been well-written? Hell no. Had I been known to use crass language online and in real life? I’ll leave that for you to decide. (The answer is yes.) Had I fallen prey in the past to trying to play the Instagram game under the guise of growing my yoga business? Yes. Can I too see the huge drawbacks of using social media sites? Hell yes. (For the record, believe they’ve helped turn us into socially-inept and isolated, disrespectful, narcissistic, and emotionally devoid robots.) Is there a story behind every photo I’ve posted? Yes. Instagram was initially intended to be a photography platform. As an homage to its beginning, I try to post photos that don’t suck. Read: no selfies. But I digress.\\n\\nI only wish my sketchbook giver had taken the time to talk to me about their perspective instead of assuming they knew me. I would have liked the chance to explain where I was coming from. They didn’t and based on their lack of a response to my invite to go to tea, I gather they don’t want to.\\n\\nThe kicker is that in an attempt to clean up Instagram, I feel the giver has made it a little worse. I miss seeing their beautiful garden photos in my feed. I miss interacting with them albeit if only via silly, short comments under their posts. This mess has hurt a real-life connection which, in my mind, is the one thing we should be trying to cultivate and protect. The irony is we met online, so to speak. We would never have met each other had it not been for a social media post I created sharing news of one of my yoga workshops. Either way, the interwebs brought us together.\\n\\nBack to the email. I did my crying over their response quickly. I had enough to cry about. I was flying home that morning to go see my dying father.\\n\\nThat was eight months ago.\\n\\nIt took me that long to write back. Pain and loss and shame and grief are tough to navigate.\\n\\nI wrote them back this past weekend before sharing this piece; it was the decent thing to do. I’m prone to leaving important emails much too long. That’s my confession. Eight months was long enough.\\n\\n**Part 2 of this post, including the story behind its photo, will be posted next week. As you can see, I do in fact use the sketchbook. I hope you can make it back to read it. Thanks in advance for doing so, x KM.',\n",

              "   'The media and the Democratic Establishment have new scapegoats for the success of President Donald J. Trump (R-New York). Those scapegoats are Facebook (NASDAQ: FB); its founder-CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and social media.\\n\\nThe theory behind this scapegoating is that ordinary people are mindless brutes Zuckerberg and Trump can control at the touch of a button. Hence, Zuckerberg can guarantee Trump’s reelection by waving his magic wand.\\n\\nRecent headlines display this sick thinking. For instance:\\n\\n“Facebook and Twitter spread Trump’s lies, so we must break them up,” Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Reich in The Guardian, 3 November 2019.\\n\\n“The Republican political operatives who call the shots at Facebook.” Popular Information newsletter 17 October 2019.\\n\\nIn addition, “How Facebook could change Trump’s 2020 re-election bid,” Gina Heeb in Markets Insider, 2 November 2019.\\n\\nOr this gem: “Mark Zuckerberg is a horror show” in The Washington Post, 20 July 2019.\\n\\nDisturbingly, Facebook’s crime in Popular Information; and Reich’s eyes, is respecting Americans’ First Amendment rights by refusing to censor political advertising. Reich fears Trump could win next year’s presidential election because Facebook respects the President’s free speech.\\n\\nMoreover, Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang’s (D-New York) first TV ad features a picture of Zuckerberg and a promise of challenging Big Tech. I have a feeling other politicians; including Trump himself, will follow Yang’s lead by jumping on the bash Facebook bandwagon.\\n\\nThe New Trump Conspiracy Theory: Blame Facebook\\n\\nThe Trump/Facebook conspiracy is simple, Zuckerberg somehow rigs Facebook posts or news feeds to show only pro Trump propaganda that makes ignorant yahoos vote for Trump.\\n\\nThe theory is preposterous because most Americans; most of whom are presumably Facebook users, voted for Hillary R. Clinton (D-New York) in 2016. In detail, Clinton received 65.845 million votes (48.2%) to Trump’s 62.980 million votes in 2016 46.1%, CNN estimates.\\n\\nFurthermore, the number of social media using 18 to 29-year-olds participating in the 2018 biannual elections rose from 20% to 36%, a 79% increase, the US Census Bureau estimates. During that election Democrats won control of the US House of Representatives in a campaign, widely seen as a rebuke of Trump.\\n\\nMoreover, polls show that younger people who are heavy social media users oppose Trump. For instance, a Harris-X poll shows only 39% of Americans under 35 approved of Trump in March 2019, The Hill reports.\\n\\nHence, social media and Facebook could benefit Democrats. Yet the New York media will never admit the possibility. One reason for this is that younger social-media savvy voters favor leftists like U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Andrew Yang (D-New York) to “moderates” like Joe Biden (D-Delaware).\\n\\nHowever, Facebook’s manipulation of voters; like Russiagate, is gospel in the Democratic Establishment. Hence, we will get a year; or more, of increasingly nonsensical Democratic attacks on fellow Democrat Zuckerberg and his company.\\n\\nIncredibly, Zuckerberg himself is a liberal who promotes far left ideas such as the basic income. In addition, Zuckerberg openly supports a Democratic presidential nominee Pete Buttigieg (D-Indiana) in the primaries, Bloomberg reports.\\n\\nPlus, Facebook Chief Operating Officer (COO) and second-in-command Sheryl Sandberg served in the U.S. Treasury Department in the Democratic Clinton administration. Hence, a Democratic company; that once invited President Barack Obama (D-Illinois) to speak on its campus, is now a target of Democratic politicians.\\n\\nWhy are Establishment Democrats Blaming Facebook for Trump?\\n\\nEstablishment Democrats’ attacks on Facebook have several motivations.\\n\\nFirst, the Democratic Establishment will never admit that Hillary R. Clinton (D-New York) was a terrible candidate who ran a horrible campaign. Second, Establishment Democrats will never admit their agenda finds no support outside the CNN studios.\\n\\nBlaming unpopular actors; like Facebook or Russia, allows Establishment Democrats to ignore their own incompetence and unpopularity. In addition, neither the media nor the Democratic Establishment will admit they are totally out of touch with the American people.\\n\\nSecond, the previous media and Democratic Establishment conspiracy: blame Russia no longer works. The American people have no interest in Russia Gate and the evidence for it is questionable. Thus, the Establishment needs a new Bogeyman ,and Facebook is a perfect Bogeyman.\\n\\nThird, attacking social media; such as Facebook, serves the interests of traditional media. The Big Media desperately wants to recover its former role as America’s primary source of information.\\n\\nOld media can achieve that goal by discrediting, or suppressing, social media. Thus, the Facebook conspiracy serves old media’s interests.\\n\\nFourth, attacks on social media can distract the people; and the media, from other problems the establishment wants to ignore. Income inequality, wage stagnation, financial insecurity, and technological unemployment, for instance.\\n\\nOne way to achieve such distraction; while looking populist and left-wing, is to bash giant social media corporations. Big Tech is unpopular because discomfort with technology is growing.\\n\\nFifth, the Democratic Establishment wants to quash the discussion of popular radical ideas such as Medicare for All, Free College, the Wealth Tax, the Value-Added Tax, the Robin Hood Tax, and a Basic Income. Yet they want to appear left-wing.\\n\\nThe New Establishment Media Bigotry\\n\\nSixth, attacking social media is a great way to manipulate popular prejudices. Notably, Zuckerberg and Sandberg are Jewish, so moderate Democrats can practice Anti-Semitism without sounding Anti-Semitic by bashing Facebook.\\n\\nSeventh media elitists can publicly engage in snobbery against ordinary Americans. To explain, the thrust of the Facebook conspiracy is that ordinary people are ignorant dolts whose minuscule minds are easy to manipulate.\\n\\nEighth, the conspiracy theory gives establishment Democrats a reason to ignore average people. The theory is that everything ordinary people believe is shallow propaganda Trump and Zuckerberg create.\\n\\nHow the Establishment will use the Facebook Conspiracy Theory\\n\\nRecent op-eds and news show us how the Democratic establishment and old media will use the Great Facebook Conspiracy theory next year.\\n\\nFirst, they will try to label any politician who deviates from their party line as a Facebook shill. Oddly, Hillary recently gave us a taste of that by calling presidential candidate and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) a “Russian asset.” Gabbard’s crime in Clinton’s eyes was to criticize elite foreign policy as bad for America.\\n\\nSecond, they will label any movement or candidate that deviates from the establishment’s Centrist party line: a Facebook front. In particular, they will label any ordinary person, candidate, or group that promotes policies such as Medicare for All, or a Basic Income, a Trump/Facebook front.\\n\\nThird, they will try to make the national discussion about the Facebook conspiracy. The Facebook conspiracy will be all they discuss. It will be the only topic on Sunday morning TV shows, at establishment websites, and in publications. TV producers will tell candidates “talk Facebook or you get no airtime.”\\n\\nFourth, they will blame any Democratic establishment failure in 2020 on Facebook. If Trump wins, that will be Facebook’s fault. If Joe Biden (D-Delaware) loses the Democratic nomination, it will be Facebook’s fault.\\n\\nIf Bernie, Liz Warren, or Yang, wins the Democratic nomination, that will be Facebook’s fault. If Sanders, Warren, or Yang, beats Trump in November 2020 that will be Facebook’s fault.\\n\\nIf the American people totally reject the Establishment Democrats’ centrist agenda, it will be Facebook’s fault. If centrist Democrats lose any elections, it will be Facebook’s fault.\\n\\nIronically, I think Zuckerberg could go from public enemy number one in left-wing Democratic circles to the man of the hour because of the conspiracy theory. Thus, the conspiracy theory could help Zuckerberg.\\n\\nWill the Conspiracy Theory Hurt Facebook Stock?\\n\\nStrangely, the great conspiracy theory has not hurt Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) stock.\\n\\nFacebook shares traded on $177.75 on 8 October 2019 and $190.57 on 8 November 2019. Thus, Mr. Market thinks Facebook is more valuable because of the conspiracy theory.\\n\\nMoreover, Stockrow estimates Facebook’s revenue grew at a rate of 28.59% in the quarter ending on 30 September 2019. Plus, Facebook reported a quarterly gross profit of $14.497 billion on 30 September 2019 up from $13.579 billion on 30 June 2019.\\n\\nFacebook reported a quarterly operating income of $7.185 billion and a quarterly net income of $6.091 billion on 30 September 2019. Those numbers were up from $4.832 billion and $2.616 billion on 30 June 2019.\\n\\nZuckerberg Laughs all the Way to the Bank\\n\\nAstoundingly, Facebook reported $52.269 billion in cash and short-term investments on 30 September 2019. That cash pile grew from $48.596 billion on 30 June 2019.\\n\\nTherefore, Zuckerberg; and Facebook stockholders, are laughing all the way to the bank as establishment Democrats peddle their ridiculous conspiracy theory. Consequently, I think establishment Democrats have no desire to hold Facebook or Zuckerberg accountable. Instead, they want a scapegoat for their own incompetence.\\n\\nI think Facebook will have little impact on next year’s presidential election. However, Facebook is still a great stock all investors need to investigate.\\n\\nThe Problem with Antisocial Media\\n\\nFor a good overview of the Great Facebook Conspiracy Theory and the growing technophobia among the intellectual elite see Siva Vaidhyanathan’s recent book “Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy”\\n\\nI think Vaidhyanathan’s work is little more than Ivy League snobbery disguised as social science. For instance, Siva, a Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia, thinks Zuckerberg could be a better person if he completed his Harvard degree. Zuckerberg’s biggest crime in Siva’s eyes was dropping out of Harvard without a degree.\\n\\nIn addition, I found blatant factual errors in the book. For instance, Vaidhyanathan; like Hillary R. Clinton, believes President Donald J. Trump (R-New York) was “the only person to lose money in the casino business.”\\n\\nIn reality, 64 U.S. casinos closed between 2016 and 2017 because they were losing money, Statista estimates. So Trump is hardly unique in losing money in gambling.\\n\\nPlus, Vaidhyanathan claims they released the movie Midnight Cowboy in 1972. Midnight Cowboy won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1969; the year they released it, IMDb notes.\\n\\nI have to question an academic who gets such basic and easily checked details wrong. Predictably Antisocial Media is popular and widely quoted.\\n\\nSorry Democrats, Facebook did not Elect Trump\\n\\nThere are real problems with social media and Facebook, but those technologies did not put Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office. Instead, a combination of Democratic incompetence, voter suppression, smart and hard-working Republican strategists, and popular discontent fueled by economic anxiety did that.\\n\\nIf Establishment Democrats want to beat Trump, they need to ignore the Great Facebook Conspiracy Theory and start treating voters with respect.',\n",

              "   'You might’ve heard that Facebook changed its algorithm in 2018 to show more posts from your friends and family instead of businesses. As a result, organic results for businesses have dropped fairly significantly. So how can you work around the recent change?\\n\\nCreate engaging content\\n\\nLet’s get the obvious out of the way. You won’t be getting any engagements or views if your content is boring and forgettable, so you need to make sure that your message, images, videos, and headline all come together to make a captivating piece of content.\\n\\nJust take a look at Slack’s content here. You‘ve probably heard of Slack before, but assuming you didn’t, I’m going to guess that you would stop to take a look at this regardless of whether you’re interested in a communications service. It brings a blend of humor and creativity to create an eye-grabbing post, which ends up helping them with user engagement.\\n\\nUse Facebook as a publishing platform\\n\\nLike I mentioned earlier, Facebook changed it’s algorithm some time last year, and because of that traffic to your page and engagement has gone down a good amount.\\n\\nHow do you work around this? Hubspot found that their content was engaging more users when Facebook was used specifically as a publishing platform. What does that mean? They used Facebook to publish content and content only. No links, no sales-y pitches, nothing of the sort.\\n\\nYou might be thinking, “how am I going to get these visitors to visit my website?” Here’s the thing, that shouldn’t be your goal anymore. Brand awareness is the only thing that Facebook should be used for now. And while your fans may not be visiting your website, your content and brand are still being viewed, so when the time comes for a follower/fan to make a purchase, they’ll certainly remember you.\\n\\nCreate content that is always relevant\\n\\nYou don’t want your content to become dated and irrelevant if your aim is to keep users engaged. According to Neil Patel, content that stays relevant for more than a few hours are known as “evergreen” content. This type of content provides value even after a few hours of being posted.\\n\\nThis image is taken directly off of Patel’s website, but note that this post was showing up over 18 hours after it was posted. That’s an insanely long time when it comes to organic views. It just goes to show you how\\n\\nPost when competitors aren’t posting\\n\\nThis might come as a surprise to you, but you don’t want to be posting your content at peak traffic times. Why is that? Because that’s what everyone else is doing! Your content is going to be lost in the sea of content that’s posted during these peak times.\\n\\nNow this doesn’t mean that you should be posting during times that none of your followers are online. You should still be scheduling your posts during times that a good amount of your followers are online. Piggybacking off of the evergreen comments above, high enough engagement will ensure that your content lasts in view for a few hours, which may in turn give you higher engagement levels than normal.\\n\\nPost regularly\\n\\nIf there was only one thing that you could take away from this whole article, posting regularly at scheduled times should be at the top of your list. By posting regularly, you’ll be ensuring that your followers are constantly in view of your content. Assuming they see your content on a regular basis, they are sure to remember your brand and your offerings.\\n\\nIf you want to read more of my articles, head over to Done. and remember to leave a comment!\\n\\nDone is a subscription-based web development service.

              "   'How Instagram learnt from Facebook: Introducing better ecommerce without affecting the social experience. Dickson Wafula Jul 13·3 min read\\n\\nNote: In this article my use of ‘Facebook’ refers to the app, not the company.\\n\\nAs a heavy user of Instagram, the news that Instagram would introduce an ecommerce feature on the app was not pleasing to me. I had seen such a move before, and it’s a move that made me almost abandon Instagram’s sister platform, Facebook. I was a moderate user of Facebook in its (not so) early days. It was a true social media app — a convenient way to interact with my friends and to meet new ones. When I opened the app, the main thing I saw were posts from my friends, or posts that my friends had interacted with, or events that they planned to attend. It made me feel connected and in touch. I liked Facebook.\\n\\nSadly, my liking didn’t turn into love, in fact, it started waning. Facebook began aggressively monetizing, heavily affecting user experience. When I logged into Facebook, the first thing I would see was no longer my friends or their posts. I would see promoted posts and advertising from ecommerce shops. The posts had a different UI (elevated cards) which made the app feel a lot more different. The app looked and felt cluttered. To me, it started losing its appeal. I had to scroll more to find my friends’ posts. Worse, I had to keep my focus and not click on the promoted links. Knowing myself, I would spend hours going through content on an external site, whose link I clicked on Facebook. The ecommerce promotions and shops not only reduced my ability to feel connected to my friends, but they also made me spend less time on Facebook. I found myself losing interest in using Facebook, and so did several of my friends.\\n\\nBack to Instagram. It’s been over a year since Instagram (explicitly) introduced ecommerce on the app. Unlike Facebook, my usage of Instagram hasn’t dropped, instead it has increased. Although it’s a limited and pretty biased sample set, my friends still use Instagram quite heavily too. Why is Instagram’s popularity not fading despite introducing the same feature that proved detrimental to Facebook (at least for people in my age group), and despite it being arguably a more competitive period (Think TikTok)?\\n\\nMy view is that they learned from Facebook’s mistakes.\\n\\nThe following features show how Instagram succeeded in integrating ecommerce without affecting the social experience, which is Instagram’s core business:\\n\\n1. A separate tab for shops gives a user choice — This may be the most important feature. The beauty of a tab is, you are at liberty to ignore it. You don’t want to see merchandise on your timeline? Fine, it’s all in your power. Unlike Facebook, Instagram does not shove anything on your main timeline unless you want to see it.\\n\\n2. A dedicated tab means they can customize the experience on the tab — the shops tab offers several features that would not be possible if shops were integrated into the timeline. It recommends new items based on your taste, it allows you to put things on your Wishlist, it even allows you to shop right on the app. Crazy, right? The ability to buy on the app does one thing that the old Facebook failed at: keeping users on the app.\\n\\n3. The explore tab to draw you into the shops — While having a separate shops tab is a good move, it runs the risk of getting completely ignored by several would-be users. That’s where the explore tab comes in. The explore tab was an already familiar and well used feature in the older version of Instagram. Its main purpose was to help a user discover other Instagram users whose content they’d like, or to just supplement the usual content they consume. It’s therefore perfect to promote shops on explore. Instagram has done this extensively, and I can say it’s very efficient, without being annoying.\\n\\nI consider these three to be the main shops-related features that have helped Instagram maintain its appeal, despite integrating e-commerce heavily. Time will tell if I stop using Instagram heavily. It may be for one reason or the other, but it will not be because of ecommerce shops cluttering my timeline. Good job Instagram, you learned!',\n",

British Airways?\\n\\nSecurity is the backbone of any company. Not money or media. Large corporations spend billions of dollars on securing their data.

              "   'Almost four years after the death of Vine (R.I.P), TikTok has taken over. While Vine offers you mere seconds to record your video, TikTok allows you to post clips up to 60 seconds long. In a world of excessive content consumption, or perhaps what might be termed as ‘addiction’, TikTok has definitely been the biggest winner of 2020. The 60-second clips are easily consumed without boring our five-year-old-like attention spans while still being long enough to allow for a wide range of creativity.This sets it apart from Vine, which mainly suited sketch comedy. After finishing the year that was 2020, a year dominated by TikTok and Covid-19, the question remains: have we become enslaved to TikTok, or are we still in control?\\n\\nWhile in quarantine, I downloaded TikTok myself. At first I was sceptical, mainly because I associated it with dance trends more than anything else, but I was willing to try anything to cure my existential crisis.The Charlie D’amelios and Addison Raes of TikTok are very much integrated into the TikTok algorithm — especially when you first join. However, as weeks went on, I discovered the many sides of TikTok. I came across my saviour and also the source of my slightly-out-of-hand, deep love of houseplants, “planttok”. There are many “toks” in the TikTok sphere with “planttok” being only one of thousands, but, in many ways, it changed my life for the better.\\n\\nI know the very idea that 60-second clips can change your life in any way sounds ridiculous and they weren’t the only reason why I fell in love with plants, but “planttok” was like adding gasoline to a small fire. My mum’s side of the family has always been in love with plants and I definitely appreciated them, but that’s about as far as my prior love and knowledge of botany went. Not to sound too spiritual, but seeing life thriving and growing is very therapeutic, especially during a pandemic. Now I have about fourteen plants and I couldn’t be happier with my new hobby. I have gained knowledge from TikTok on how to get rid of common houseplant pests and bugs and have a fountain of knowledge regarding plant keeping. I don’t rely solely on TikTok advice when it comes to my botanical specimens but it’s always nice to get someone’s personal experience with a similar problem you are having.\\n\\nI believe that there is a lot of useful content on TikTok that is worth looking at. Another “tok” page I have enjoyed is “foodtok” which has expanded my mediocre cooking skills. And now that I live alone, it gives me a bit of variety in my meals so that I don’t end up eating pasta with a sauce from a jar for every course.\\n\\nAs much as I would like to sing these praises all day long, we must address the negative and often, the dark side of TikTok. I am the first person to say that I try to spend less time on my phone but TikTok is one of those apps that just makes you keep scrolling. Like eating pringles where once you pop, you can’t stop,you can keep swiping for hours and still not feel satiated. While a bit of escapism once in a while — especially in this climate — is quite healthy, I would go insane if I constantly consumed intellectual content and news every day. But I think most people will agree with me when I say that we as a society spend too much time scrolling.\\n\\nThe problem with TikTok and its addictive nature stems from the fact that they are little entertaining videos which is the platform’s unique selling point. Compared to Instagram or Facebook, where the main form of content is pictures, Tiktok content is by its nature more time consuming. Another addictive aspect of TikTok is the fact that the content is endless. When you scroll down on Instagram, it’ll eventually stop showing you new content because it works on the basis of the number of people you follow. With TikTok that is not the case; once you dive into that black hole of dance videos and mesmerising resin creations, you can waste hours — or a whole day — on this app. This addictive aspect of TikTok is definitely part of the reason why it has gained a bad reputation. I would defend the use of TikTok when it comes to adults. It’s everyone’s freedom to decide how much time one spends on social media. However, when it comes to children and teenagers, it’s a bit of a different situation as some might not recognise their social media usage as having a negative impact on them. I wonder if, in a few years time, there will be healthy social media usage recommendations for everyone?\\n\\nWith the recent ban of TikTok in India and the potential ban in the US there have been some concerns with regards to the privacy aspect of TikTok. Both governments state that they are concerned with TikTok being owned by a Chinese company, as all such companies abide by a rule that states that they have to hand over their data to the Chinese government if they request it. Data information and its possible use can be very harmful on both national and personal levels. Whether it’s the US, UK, China or any other country, I am not a fan of my data usage being given to any government. TikTok has rebuttled the threat of the US ban by stating that this law applies to only Chinese user data and that US data is stored elsewhere and does not fall under this law. Sharing data is scarily more of a reality than perhaps we would like to believe. I think that this is another issue which would need legislation in the future, but for now I think your choice is to either use social media apps and be aware of the fact that your data is being used by other companies or not use social media at all. And let’s be honest, I think all of us would choose to use social media.\\n\\nSo, have we become so obsessed with TikTok? Yes, I think we have in many ways, mainly because of its addictive nature, but I wouldn’t fully agree with the negative press over the past few months. When it comes to areas such as privacy and content consumption, we still have our ways to go, but this issue is not limited to TikTok. TikTok has just highlighted the issues that were already there. We all have the agency to limit our social media usage and censor the content we watch. I believe that TikTok is here to stay, so we just need to decide how we’ll use it and what we use it for.',\n",

              "   'The Aud Dev Digest / July 13, 2021\\n\\nThere was a lot to choose from this week! New Instagram features on the horizon, a guide to virtual programming, and some very legit questions about why the NY BOE decided to be cute during a tense mayoral election. Let us start!\\n\\n1️⃣ File this under the “FINALLY” category — just let people share links if they want to share links! “Link in bio” is tedious, and I’m all for a tool that makes it easier for the non-influencer to promote their work or what they’re reading. I’m sure there are pitfalls to this strategy (misinfo, spam, etc) but overall, I like the democratization of “premium” features, and how this one in particular makes follower growth less crucial. It lowers the bar for who can be an influencer — you can have a small community of, say, 1,000 followers and still share content with them! Read the full story at The Verge:\\n\\n2️⃣ I do not like criticizing social media accounts/managers because running just one account is hard work, and social editors are often running at least three. That being said, I appreciated this issue of Embedded, on weird tone choice for New York BOE’s Twitter during the mayoral election. While brand accounts adopting “human” personalities has become a trend and engagement tactic, it doesn’t necessarily work here — it becomes distracting and a little anxiety-inducing. Kate Lindsay writes:\\n\\nBut the BOE isn’t a brand, it’s a public service, and a crucial one. It doesn’t need to drive engagement or grow its following. It doesn’t need clicks or people to purchase its product. It needs to relay information in a clear, timely manner.\\n\\nI think what I take away from this moment is the importance of an audience development or social media team. These are high-visibility and high-impact spaces, and it’s unfair to have one person managing the strategy, execution, and analysis on multiple platforms, all with different trends and audiences and best practices. So instead of dunking on whoever is behind the BOE Twitter (Kate has a guess), I would say that all companies should remember that, once again, a social media account isn’t “easy” to run and requires the thoughtfulness and collaboration of a group of colleagues, working together to make it as effective as possible. My hypothesis: Bigger social teams would lead to fewer social media faux pas. Read the full post on Embedded:\\n\\n3️⃣ I nerded out reading about how LA Times created virtual programming for the pandemic. I love the interview’s approach here — asking what problems the Times aimed to solve, how they developed programming, what worked/what didn’t. It made me think about how the pandemic forced a lot of media organizations to shift strategy quickly, at first, but then develop longer-term, sustainable pivots to fit the circumstances. It wasn’t like a big breaking news pivot; it required reimagining core business tentpoles and really leaning into audience listening. Highly recommend!\\n\\nAnd this week’s tweet is a “read the responses” kind of tweet:',\n",
